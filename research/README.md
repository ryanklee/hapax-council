## Lab Journal

The lab journal is a Quarto site deployed to GitHub Pages: [`../lab-journal/`](../lab-journal/).

## Theory-to-Code Traceability

See [THEORY-MAP.md](./THEORY-MAP.md) for a matrix mapping theoretical claims to code locations.

## Pre-registration

*OSF registration pending. Will be linked here when filed.*

## Data Availability

*Data collection has not yet begun for Cycle 2. Data availability statement will be added when the experiment is complete.*

## Conventions

- **Raw data is immutable.** Never modify files in `data/raw/`. Process into `data/processed/`.
- **Protocols are versioned.** Use `protocol-v{N}.{M}.md` naming. Never overwrite — create amendments.
- **Configs are committed.** Experiment configurations must be version-controlled, not set via environment variables.
- **Results are reproducible.** Every file in `results/` must be regenerable from `data/` + `analysis/` scripts.
