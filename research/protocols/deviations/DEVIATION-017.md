# Deviation Record: DEVIATION-017

**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Phase at time of change:** baseline
**Author:** Claude Code (beta session)

## What Changed

`agents/hapax_daimonion/proofs/RESEARCH-STATE.md` — resolved merge conflict markers
left by `git stash pop`. No content was added or removed; the conflict was between
an older version (session 9) and the current version (session 17). Resolution kept
the current (upstream) content which was already on main via prior merged PRs.

## Why

Merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) were present in the file,
left by a failed `git stash pop`. These markers caused no runtime impact (markdown
file) but blocked all commits on main due to pre-commit hooks detecting them.

## Impact on Experiment Validity

None. No experiment code, grounding theory, or research design was altered. The
file content after resolution is identical to what was already on main before the
stash pop — the conflict arose from the stash containing an older snapshot.

## Mitigation

Diff verified: only conflict markers removed. No session content added, removed,
or modified. File matches the state from the most recent merged PR (#322).
