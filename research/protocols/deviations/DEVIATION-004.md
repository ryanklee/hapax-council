# Deviation Record: DEVIATION-004

**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Phase at time of change:** baseline
**Author:** alpha (Claude Opus 4.6)

## What Changed

Modified: `agents/hapax_daimonion/proofs/RESEARCH-STATE.md` — updated session 10 findings, added context-as-computation research summary, added new open questions.

## Why

RESEARCH-STATE.md is the continuity document that must be updated after every session with research progress (per CLAUDE.md directive). Session 10 produced significant research findings (context-as-computation mechanistic justification) and decisions (black-box-first sequence) that must be recorded for cross-session context persistence.

## Impact on Experiment Validity

**None.** RESEARCH-STATE.md is a metadata/tracking document. It contains no experiment code, scoring functions, or behavioral code. Updating it is required by the research protocol itself.

## Mitigation

The freeze manifest should consider excluding RESEARCH-STATE.md from the inner zone, since it is a living document that MUST be updated during active experiment phases by design. Current workaround: deviation record per update.
