# CLAUDE.md

Externalized executive function infrastructure. LLM agents handle cognitive work (tracking open loops, maintaining context, surfacing what needs attention) for a single operator on a single workstation. Single-operator is a constitutional axiom — no auth, no roles, no multi-user code anywhere.

Shared conventions (uv, ruff, testing, git workflow, pydantic-ai) are in the workspace `CLAUDE.md` — this file covers council-specific details only.

## Architecture

**Filesystem-as-bus**: Agents read/write markdown files with YAML frontmatter on disk. A reactive engine (inotify) watches for changes and cascades downstream work.

**Three tiers**:
- **Tier 1** — Interactive interfaces (hapax-logos Tauri native app, waybar GTK4 status bar, VS Code extension)
- **Tier 2** — LLM-driven agents (pydantic-ai, routed through LiteLLM at :4000)
- **Tier 3** — Deterministic agents (sync, health, maintenance — no LLM calls)

**Reactive engine** (`logos/engine/`): inotify watcher → 14 rules → phased execution (deterministic first, then LLM semaphore-bounded at max 2 concurrent).

**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for databases/proxies (13 containers), systemd user units for all application services. No process-compose in production. See `systemd/README.md` for boot sequence, resource isolation, and recovery chain.

**Key services**: `hapax-secrets` (credentials) → `logos-api` (:8051) → `waybar` (GTK4 status bar) → `hapax-daimonion` (GPU) → `visual-layer-aggregator` → `studio-compositor` (GPU). 31 timers for sync, health, backups. Archival pipeline (audio/video recording, classification, RAG ingest) disabled — see `systemd/README.md § Disabled Services`.

## Design Language

`docs/logos-design-language.md` is the authority document for all visual surfaces. It governs color (§3), typography (§1.6), spatial model (§4), animation (§6), mode switching (§2), and scope (§11). All component colors must use CSS custom properties (`var(--color-*)`) or Tailwind classes — no hardcoded hex except detection overlays (§3.8). `docs/logos-ui-reference.md` governs region content (what appears at each depth). Classification inspector (`C` key) is exempt from density rules — diagnostic tool with theme-aware colors.

## Logos API

FastAPI on `:8051`. `uv run logos-api` to start. Containers: `docker compose up -d`.

## Command Registry

Centralized automation layer for all Logos UI actions. Every action (focus region, activate preset, toggle overlay) is a registered command with typed args and observable events.

**Access points:**
- **Playwright / browser console**: `window.__logos.execute("terrain.focus", { region: "ground" })`
- **Keyboard**: Single adapter in `CommandRegistryProvider`, key map in `lib/keyboardAdapter.ts`
- **External (MCP, voice)**: WebSocket relay at `ws://localhost:8052/ws/commands` (Rust, inside Tauri)
- **CommandPalette**: Reads from `registry.list()` dynamically

**Key files:**
- `hapax-logos/src/lib/commandRegistry.ts` — Core registry (framework-agnostic)
- `hapax-logos/src/lib/commands/*.ts` — Domain registrations (terrain, studio, overlay, detection, nav, split, data)
- `hapax-logos/src/lib/commands/sequences.ts` — Built-in sequences (studio.enter, studio.exit, escape)
- `hapax-logos/src/lib/keyboardAdapter.ts` — Key map with `when`-clause conditional bindings
- `hapax-logos/src/contexts/CommandRegistryContext.tsx` — React provider, `window.__logos`, keyboard handler
- `hapax-logos/src/components/terrain/CommandRegistryBridge.tsx` — Bridges studio/detection contexts
- `hapax-logos/src/lib/commandBridge.ts` — Tauri event bridge for command relay
- `hapax-logos/src-tauri/src/commands/relay.rs` — Rust WebSocket relay server (:8052)

**State mirrors:** The provider maintains synchronous state mirrors updated eagerly by action wrappers. This ensures `query()` returns post-execution state without waiting for React re-render. Mirrors sync from React state on each render.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-03-26-logos-command-registry-design.md`

## Tauri-Only Runtime

Logos is a Tauri 2 native app. The frontend speaks **only IPC** — zero browser `fetch()` calls. All API communication goes through `invoke()` to Rust commands, which proxy to FastAPI at `:8051` internally.

**Key services inside Tauri process:**
- **IPC commands** — 60+ invoke handlers (health, state, studio, governance, proxy passthrough)
- **SSE bridge** — Rust subscribes to FastAPI SSE streams, re-emits as Tauri events (`commands/streaming.rs`)
- **Command relay** — WebSocket server on `:8052` for MCP/voice (`commands/relay.rs`)
- **HTTP frame server** — Axum on `:8053` serves visual surface JPEG frames (`visual/http_server.rs`)

**Visual surface (Hapax Reverie):** A standalone binary (`hapax-imagination`) runs as a systemd user service, rendering dynamic shader graphs via wgpu. Python compiles effect presets (`agents/effect_graph/wgsl_compiler.py`) into WGSL execution plans that the Rust `DynamicPipeline` hot-reloads from `/dev/shm/hapax-imagination/pipeline/`. The permanent vocabulary graph runs 7 passes: `noise → color → drift → breath → feedback → content_layer → postprocess`. The feedback node is temporal (`@accum_fb`) enabling dwelling traces (Bachelard Amendment 2). Per-node shader params flow from Python visual chain → `uniforms.json` → Rust per-frame override bridge. Visual chain technique names match vocabulary node IDs (`noise`, `fb`, `post`). 9 expressive dimensions in the GPU uniform buffer: intensity, tension, depth, coherence, spectral_color, temporal_distortion, degradation, pitch_displacement, diffusion. The DMN evaluative tick reads rendered frames via gemini-flash (multimodal) and writes observations for reverberation detection (Amendment 4). Frames written to `/dev/shm/hapax-visual/frame.jpg` via turbojpeg. Content layer supports per-slot immensity entry and continuation-aware crossfade. The `VisualSurface` React component fetches frames at 30fps from `:8053`. Tauri communicates via UDS (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hapax-imagination.sock`). The winit window is independently positioned (multi-monitor, fullscreen, borderless, always-on-top).

**NVIDIA + Wayland:** webkit2gtk 2.50.6 has a syncobj protocol bug that crashes the app on native Wayland with NVIDIA ([gtk#8056](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/8056), [tauri#10702](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10702)). Workaround: `__NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1` (set in systemd unit and `.envrc`). See `docs/issues/tauri-wayland-protocol-error.md`.

**Dev workflow:** `pnpm tauri dev` is the only dev path. Vite serves assets to the Tauri webview only — no proxy, no exposed API.

## Council-Specific Conventions

- Hypothesis for property-based algebraic proofs.
- Working mode file: `~/.cache/hapax/working-mode` (research/rnd). CLI: `hapax-working-mode`.
- Safety: LLMs prepare, humans deliver. Never generate feedback language or coaching recommendations about individual team members.

## Axiom Governance

5 axioms (3 constitutional, 2 domain) enforced via `shared/axiom_*.py`, `shared/consent.py`, and commit hooks:

| Axiom | Weight | Constraint |
|-------|--------|------------|
| single_user | 100 | One operator. No auth, roles, or collaboration features. |
| executive_function | 95 | Zero-config agents, errors include next actions, routine work automated. |
| corporate_boundary | 90 | Work data stays in employer systems. Home system = personal + management-practice only. |
| interpersonal_transparency | 88 | No persistent state about non-operator persons without active consent contract. |
| management_governance | 85 | LLMs prepare, humans deliver. No generated feedback/coaching about individuals. |

T0 violations blocked by SDLC hooks. Definitions in `axioms/registry.yaml`, implications in `axioms/implications/`, consent contracts in `axioms/contracts/`.

## SDLC Pipeline

LLM-driven lifecycle via GitHub Actions: Triage → Plan → Implement → Adversarial Review (3 rounds max) → Axiom Gate → Auto-merge. Scripts in `scripts/`, workflows in `.github/workflows/`. All scripts support `--dry-run`. Observability via `profiles/sdlc-events.jsonl` + Langfuse traces. Agent PRs only on `agent/*` branches with `agent-authored` label.

## Claude Code Hooks (`hooks/scripts/`)

PreToolUse hooks enforce branch discipline and safety at the tool-call level:

| Hook | Gates | Blocks when |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `work-resolution-gate.sh` | Edit, Write | Feature branch with commits but no PR; on main with open PRs whose branch is local |
| `no-stale-branches.sh` | Bash | **Branch creation:** any unmerged branches exist. **Destructive commands** (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git branch -f`, `git worktree remove`): on a feature branch with commits ahead of main |
| `push-gate.sh` | Bash | Push without passing tests |
| `pii-guard.sh` | Edit, Write | PII patterns in file content |
| `axiom-commit-scan.sh` | Bash | Commit messages violating axiom patterns |
| `session-context.sh` | Bash | Advisory: session context and relay status |

Destructive command detection strips quoted strings before matching to prevent false positives from commit messages that discuss git commands.

## IR Perception (Pi NoIR Edge Fleet)

3 Raspberry Pi 4s with Pi Camera Module 3 NoIR under 850nm IR flood illumination. Each runs `hapax-ir-edge` daemon: fine-tuned YOLOv8n (ONNX Runtime) person detection + NIR hand thresholding + screen detection. Captures via `rpicam-still`, POSTs structured JSON to council every ~3s.

**Pi fleet:**
- **Pi-1** (hapax-pi1, 192.168.68.78) — ir-desk, co-located with C920-desk
- **Pi-2** (hapax-pi2, 192.168.68.52) — ir-room, co-located with C920-room
- **Pi-4** (hapax-pi4, 192.168.68.53) — sentinel (health monitor, watch backup)
- **Pi-5** (hapax-pi5, 192.168.68.72) — rag-edge (document preprocessing)
- **Pi-6** (hapax-pi6, 192.168.68.74) — sync-hub + ir-overhead, co-located with C920-overhead

**IR data flow:** Pi daemon → `POST /api/pi/{role}/ir` (`logos/api/routes/pi.py`) → `~/hapax-state/pi-noir/{role}.json` → `ir_presence` backend (FAST tier, 13 signals) → perception engine → perception-state.json.

**Health/observability:** All 5 Pis report heartbeats every 60s via `hapax-heartbeat.timer` → `POST /api/pi/{hostname}/heartbeat` → `~/hapax-state/edge/{hostname}.json`. Health monitor `check_pi_fleet()` validates freshness, service status, CPU temp, memory, disk. Failures feed into stimmung health dimension and ntfy alerts.

**Key files:**
- `pi-edge/` — Edge daemon + heartbeat code (deployed to each Pi at `~/hapax-edge/`)
- `shared/ir_models.py` — Shared Pydantic schema (IrDetectionReport)
- `agents/hapax_daimonion/backends/ir_presence.py` — Perception backend (multi-Pi fusion)
- `agents/hapax_daimonion/ir_signals.py` — State file reader
- `agents/health_monitor.py` — `PI_FLEET` dict defines expected services per Pi

**Inference:** ONNX Runtime preferred (130ms, preserves fine-tuned precision), TFLite fallback. Model: YOLOv8n fine-tuned on 30 NIR studio frames (`best.onnx`).

**Fusion logic:** Person detection = any() across Pis. Gaze/biometrics prefer desk Pi (face-on). Hand activity prefers overhead Pi. Staleness cutoff: 15s. Presence engine signal weight: `ir_person_detected: (0.90, 0.10)`.

**Face landmarks currently disabled** — fdlite incompatible with NumPy 2.x on Trixie (`np.math` removed). Degrades gracefully.

## Key Modules

- **`shared/config.py`** — Model aliases, LiteLLM/Qdrant clients, embedding, `DATA_DIR`
- **`shared/working_mode.py`** — Reads `~/.cache/hapax/working-mode` (research/rnd). CLI: `hapax-working-mode`
- **`shared/notify.py`** — `send_notification()` for ntfy + desktop
- **`shared/frontmatter.py`** — Canonical frontmatter parser (never duplicate this)
- **`shared/dimensions.py`** — 11 profile dimensions. Sync agents produce behavioral facts only.
- **`shared/consent.py`** — `ConsentContract`, `ConsentRegistry`, `contract_check()`
- **`shared/agent_registry.py`** — `AgentManifest` (4-layer schema), query by category/capability/RACI

## Voice Grounding Research Continuity

Research state persists in `agents/hapax_daimonion/proofs/RESEARCH-STATE.md`. After any session with research decisions or implementation progress on the voice grounding project, update this file before ending. When the operator says "refresh research context" or "update research context", read the state file and selectively read the tier-2 documents it references.

## Composition Ladder Protocol (hapax_daimonion)

Bottom-up building discipline for the hapax_daimonion type system. 10 layers (L0–L9), all proven. 7-dimension test matrix per layer. Gate rule: no new composition on layer N unless N-1 is matrix-complete. See `agents/hapax_daimonion/LAYER_STATUS.yaml` for current status and `tests/hapax_daimonion/test_type_system_matrix*.py` for the 192 matrix tests.

**3-question heuristic** before every change:
1. What layer does this touch?
2. Is the layer below matrix-complete? (If no → fix that first)
3. Which dimensions does this test cover? (Update LAYER_STATUS.yaml)
