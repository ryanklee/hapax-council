"""Evil Pet base-scene writer — MIDI CC burst for deterministic startup.

Writes every audio-processing parameter on the Evil Pet to the base-config
values from docs/research/2026-04-19-evil-pet-s4-base-config.md §3.8 via
MIDI CCs on the Erica Synths MIDI Dispatch (USB → CalDigit) on channel 1.

Operator runs this once per session start (or we wire it into daimonion
startup once validated). Source select (LINE), input gain trim, and
MIDI channel config are hardware-only and must be set on the device:

  1. Source button: LINE  (front-panel, confirmed on OLED)
  2. SHIFT + ENCODER input trim: ~11 o'clock
  3. Config → MIDI receive channel: 1 (0-indexed on this script, = ch 1 on wire)

After this script runs, vocal_chain.py's semantic CC modulation takes
over on top of the scene.
