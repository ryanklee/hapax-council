# PC → L-12 CH 11/12 level-matching design

## Problem

L-12 CH 11/12 receives Ryzen analog-stereo output, which mixes a dissimilar set of PC-originated streams:

| Stream source | Typical unprocessed peak | Typical unprocessed RMS | Spectral character |
|---|---|---|---|
| YouTube music beds (via yt-loudnorm OR raw) | −3 to 0 dBFS | −14 to −9 LUFS | broadband, wide dynamics |
| Hapax voice (Kokoro TTS) | −3 to −1 dBFS | −16 to −12 LUFS | mid-band dominant, fast transients |
| Browser / streaming video | −1 to 0 dBFS | −24 to −9 LUFS (highly variable) | broadband, unpredictable |
| Notifications (chimes, system) | 0 dBFS | −18 to −6 LUFS peak-heavy | transient, sparse |
| PC-audio general | wildly variable | wildly variable | anything |

With unmatched levels, a single L-12 CH 11/12 trim is a compromise: set too high, voice + chimes clip; set too low, YT music is inaudible. Operator spends cognitive load on the fader that should be spent on the stream.

## Principle

**Every PC-originated stream must exit Ryzen at the same target loudness.** The target is defined as:

- **Integrated loudness:** **−20 LUFS**
- **True peak:** **−3 dBTP** (3 dB hard ceiling for inter-sample peaks)
- **Rationale:** −20 LUFS leaves ~12 dB of broadcast headroom against −8 LUFS stream-target; −3 dBTP leaves 3 dB for downstream ADC / codec tolerance. Below radio-loud (−14) so music beds don't dominate voice, above hearing-threshold so chimes remain audible.

When every source hits Ryzen at −20 LUFS / −3 dBTP, the L-12 CH 11/12 trim becomes a **single additive offset** (e.g. +6 dB trim to reach −14 LUFS at main mix) that works identically for voice, music, video, notifications.

## Stream-by-stream design

### 1. YouTube music beds

**Current path:** ffmpeg (yt-player) → role.multimedia loopback → pc-loudnorm → Ryzen.

**Current config (`config/pipewire/pc-loudnorm.conf`):**
- threshold −14 dB, ratio 3:1, makeup +3 dB, limit −1 dBTP
- Integrated loudness output: ~−14 LUFS

**Target config changes:**
- Lower threshold to −18 dB (more aggressive compression floor)
- Keep ratio 3:1
- **Drop makeup gain from +3 dB to −3 dB**
- Lower limit from −1 to −3 dBTP
- Integrated loudness output becomes ~−20 LUFS

Alternatively, add a dedicated yt-loudnorm between the yt-player ffmpeg output and pc-loudnorm so YT's wide dynamics get pre-conditioned before hitting pc-loudnorm's broadband compressor. This is already scaffolded as `hapax-yt-loudnorm` sink (see yt-loudnorm.conf) but it's IDLE — ffmpeg bypasses it. Wiring yt-player through it is a separate fix (not in this design's scope).

### 2. Hapax voice (TTS)

**Designed path:** daimonion pw-cat → voice-fx-chain (biquad EQ) → voice-fx-loudnorm (SC4 + limiter) → Ryzen.

**Currently BYPASSED** — streams hit role.assistant loopback → Ryzen directly. See `docs/research/2026-04-21-livestream-surface-inventory-audit.md` §3.K and cc-task lssh-012. Persistent fix lands in `config/wireplumber/55-hapax-voice-role-retarget.conf` (this repo).

**Current voice-fx-loudnorm config:**
- SC4 threshold −18 dB, ratio 3:1, makeup 0 dB
- Limiter ceiling −1 dBTP
- Integrated loudness output: ~−14 LUFS (matches pc-loudnorm old target)

**Target config changes:**
- Keep SC4 threshold −18 dB, ratio 3:1
- **Add −3 dB makeup gain** (so output sits at −20 LUFS)
- Lower limiter ceiling from −1 to −3 dBTP
- Voice-fx-chain UPSTREAM stays unchanged (EQ is intent-preserving; loudness math is on voice-fx-loudnorm).

### 3. Browser / streaming video (generic PC audio)

**Current path:** browser → role.multimedia loopback → pc-loudnorm → Ryzen. Shared with YouTube beds.

**Target:** same pc-loudnorm re-tune as YouTube beds (−20 LUFS / −3 dBTP). No separate config needed.

**Caveat:** if video and music beds play simultaneously, pc-loudnorm's compressor sums them before the broadband curve fires — mix could sound over-compressed. If operator reports this, add a per-source pre-chain later. Not worth pre-solving.

### 4. Notifications (chimes, system sounds)

**Current path:** `role.notification` loopback → `hapax-private` → `hapax-private-playback` → Ryzen. Does NOT go through pc-loudnorm.

**Current normalization:** NONE. Chimes hit Ryzen at native app levels — typically 0 dBFS peaks.

**Target:** route notifications through a dedicated `hapax-notification-loudnorm` filter chain that applies:
- Peak limiter at −3 dBTP (no compression — notifications are short; don't kill transient)
- Gain offset to match −20 LUFS peak target (roughly −10 dB padding from 0 dBFS)
- Insert between `hapax-notification-private` and `hapax-private`

Alternatively (simpler): drop `hapax-private-playback` sink-input volume to 30% as a static attenuation. Less precise than a filter chain but close enough for chimes. Trade: notifications stop being transient-rich.

### 5. Hapax-private (DMN-internal audio)

**Current path:** Same as notifications but semantically distinct — DMN internal audio uses this path for operator-private monitoring. Goes to Ryzen today.

**Target:** leave at native levels. DMN-private is not broadcast (routed separately via L-6 ch 5 per the `hapax-private` node description). If it hits Ryzen → L-12 CH 11/12, that's a routing bug separate from level-matching.

## Summary — proposed end-state

| Source | Path | Loudness target | Config location |
|---|---|---|---|
| YouTube beds | role.multimedia → pc-loudnorm → Ryzen | −20 LUFS / −3 dBTP | pc-loudnorm.conf (re-tune) |
| Browser / video | role.multimedia → pc-loudnorm → Ryzen | −20 LUFS / −3 dBTP | pc-loudnorm.conf (shared) |
| Hapax voice | role.assistant → voice-fx-chain → voice-fx-loudnorm → Ryzen | −20 LUFS / −3 dBTP | voice-fx-loudnorm.conf (re-tune) + 55-hapax-voice-role-retarget.conf (routing fix) |
| Notifications | role.notification → hapax-notification-loudnorm → Ryzen | peak −3 dBTP, no comp | new conf + wire into hapax-private path |
| DMN-private | (private monitoring; not broadcast) | unchanged | — |

After these changes land:

- L-12 CH 11/12 trim calibrated ONCE for −20 LUFS input.
- All PC-originated audio arrives at that reference level regardless of source.
- Fader does one job, predictably.

## Operator decision points

1. **Ratify the −20 LUFS / −3 dBTP target**, or specify a different pair. Common alternatives: −18 LUFS (hotter, radio-like) or −23 LUFS (EBU R128 broadcast standard).
2. **Notification handling:** dedicated loudnorm or static attenuation?
3. **Deployment timing:** config changes require PipeWire restart. Operator picks a low-risk window to apply.

## Current live band-aid (non-persistent, 2026-04-21 ~23:10-23:15 UTC)

Per-stream sink-input volume attenuation to approximate the −20 LUFS design without waiting for config deploy:

| Stream | sink-input | Volume | dB |
|---|---|---|---|
| pc-loudnorm → Ryzen | SI100 | 40% | −24 dB |
| voice-fx-loudnorm → Ryzen (dormant path) | SI105 | 50% | −18 dB |
| role.assistant → Ryzen (actual voice path) | SI516 | 35% | −27 dB |
| hapax-private → Ryzen | SI93 | 100% | 0 dB |

All reset on next PipeWire restart. The persistent fixes in `config/pipewire/pc-loudnorm.conf` + `config/pipewire/voice-fx-loudnorm.conf` + the new notification loudnorm replace the need for these attenuations.
