# Drop #62 Option C ratification — Hermes 3 substrate path

**Date:** 2026-04-15
**Author:** beta (autonomous LRR + cam-stability session continuation, identified as "real beta" in delta's 2026-04-15T04:45Z inflection)
**Authority:** operator direct confirmation via session terminal at 2026-04-15T04:40Z
**Status:** RATIFIED
**Scope:** Drop #62 §10 open question #1 only. Questions #2–#10 remain open.

---

## 1. What was ratified

Drop #62 §4 recommended resolving the LRR Phase 5 / HSEA Phase 4 I4 substrate conflict via **option (c)**: fork LRR Phase 5 into two unified phases:

- **UP-7a (was LRR Phase 5):** Hermes 3 **8B parallel** pivot. Owner: LRR. Research-validity-load-bearing. Inherits all of LRR Phase 5's exit criteria (consent-revocation drill, speech-continuity drill, CAPABLE-tier preservation), executed against the 8B parallel config instead of the 70B layer-split.
- **UP-7b (deferred backlog):** Hermes 3 **70B** path. Gated on either (i) different hardware (PCIe Gen 5 dual-Blackwell, single-card 80GB Blackwell, or similar) or (ii) empirically demonstrated sub-2s 70B inference under the `interpersonal_transparency` consent-latency constraint. Until then, 5b is a backlog item, not an LRR phase.

Drop #62 §10 lists 10 open operator questions; this doc ratifies **question #1 only**. Questions #2 (T2.8 guardrail DEVIATION cycle), #3 (HSEA Phase 4 rescoping), #4 (state file design), #5 (hapax-constitution PR vehicle), #6 (Cluster H timing), #7 (worktree allocation), #8 (research-stream-state.yaml authority), #9 (drop #62 doc path), #10 (phase ordering deviation tolerance) remain open and are **not** touched by this ratification.

## 2. Rationale (summarized from drop #62 §4 + drop #56 v3)

The 70B path was unreachable under the operator's own `interpersonal_transparency` consent-latency axiom before drop #62 was written. Drop #56 v3 established the bound: 70B layer-split inference on Blackwell + Ampere cannot meet the <2s consent-revocation round-trip the constitutional axiom requires. Drop #57 T2.6 reified this as "8B parallel, not swap." HSEA Phase 4 I4 codified the implementation sketch. Drop #62 §4 surfaced the three options and recommended option (c) as the cleanest path that preserves LRR's research integrity machinery while deleting the duplicate substrate code in HSEA Phase 4.

Option (a) — replace Phase 5 entirely with the 8B pivot — loses LRR Phase 5's exit criteria which are the right exit criteria for any substrate change, not just 70B. Rejected.

Option (b) — keep LRR Phase 5 as written, ship 70B via HSEA Phase 4 I4 with axiom precedent update — places substrate deployment in a drafter phase. Drafters don't deploy. Also ignores drop #56 v3. Rejected.

Option (c) — fork into 5a + 5b — preserves exit criteria, surfaces drop #56 v3 as a binding axiom decision, eliminates HSEA Phase 4 duplicate substrate code, leaves a clear path back to 70B if the hardware envelope changes, and makes the LRR/HSEA boundary cleaner (LRR ships substrate, HSEA narrates it). Accepted.

## 3. Downstream implications

### 3.1 LRR spec (NOT edited in this PR)

The LRR spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-14-livestream-research-ready-epic-design.md` still describes Phase 5 as the 70B layer-split path. LRR spec edits are owned by the real beta session via PR #819 (`beta-phase-4-bootstrap` branch) and will be applied there during rebase. This ratification doc is the reference that rebase should cite.

Per delta's 2026-04-15T04:45Z inflection (§"For beta (PR #819 author)"): the Phase 5 spec needs a small edit renaming references from "70B layer split" to "8B parallel" and adding a note referencing drop #56 v3 + the axiom-precedent rule. `DEVIATION-037` text also shifts from "70B procedure" to "8B pivot rationale + reference to drop #56 v3 + reference to consent-latency axiom." The `scripts/phase-5-*.py` files at `beta-phase-4-bootstrap` commit history should be reviewed for 70B-specific assumptions (GPU memory budgets, layer-split config, `hapax-dmn` eviction) — many become unnecessary under 8B.

### 3.2 HSEA spec and plan (already edited in drop #62)

Drop #62's commit already applied the §9 edits to both HSEA spec and HSEA plan (Section 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the spec; Section 1, 4, 8 in the plan). No further edits are needed to reflect option (c). The HSEA spec header still says "DRAFT — awaiting operator sign-off before Phase 0 open" because questions #2–#10 from drop #62 §10 remain open; option (c)'s confirmation does not release the sign-off gate.

### 3.3 HSEA Phase 4 cluster I rescoping (partial)

Confirmation of option (c) implies that HSEA Phase 4 sub-drafters **I4a / I4b / I4c** are demoted to narration-only spectator agents (they watch LRR Phase 5a's 8B pivot landing and draft a research drop summarizing it). Rough LOC delta on HSEA Phase 4: **−600 LOC** from the three I4 sub-drafters alone. This is a subset of drop #62 §10 question #3 (the full rescoping across I1–I5 is still pending). Treat I4 as resolved; I1/I2/I3/I5 still need operator confirmation separately.

### 3.4 DEVIATION-037 content

The `DEVIATION-037` document (currently pending on PR #819) should describe the **8B pivot** rationale + reference to drop #56 v3 + reference to the consent-latency axiom, **not** the 70B procedure. The real beta session (PR #819 author) should update the DEVIATION draft before PR #819 merges.

### 3.5 OSF pre-registration amendment

The OSF amendment (drop #57 T2.7, current LRR Phase 4 item 4) should explicitly name the **8B arm as the C2 condition** in the pre-registration; the original 70B language is replaced or annotated. This is operator action through the OSF portal, not code.

### 3.6 Axiom precedent

LRR Phase 6 (UP-8) governance pass should formalize the rule: "any future 70B substrate decision must pre-register a consent-revocation drill and pass it before being authorized." This lands in the same `it-irreversible-broadcast` PR vehicle.

## 4. Repo scaffolding shipped in this PR

Two draft systemd artifacts for the second TabbyAPI instance. **Neither is deployed.** They exist as pre-staging for LRR Phase 5a execution; the session that opens UP-7a will review, adjust GPU allocation per empirical verification, and deploy.

### 4.1 `systemd/units/tabbyapi-hermes8b.service` (new, draft)

Second-instance TabbyAPI unit running Hermes 3 8B on port 5001, isolated from the existing `tabbyapi.service` (Qwen 3.5-9B on port 5000). `WorkingDirectory` points at the existing `tabbyAPI/` sibling checkout using a per-instance `--config` override so the second instance reads `config.yml.hermes-8b` instead of the default `config.yml`.

### 4.2 `systemd/units/tabbyapi-hermes8b.service.d/gpu-pin.conf` (new, draft)

GPU pin drop-in. **TODO marker:** the specific `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` + `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER` values need empirical verification before deployment. Current Option γ allocation (both GPUs visible for 70B layer-split) is wrong for 8B parallel — each instance should pin to a different single GPU. The draft drop-in captures the two candidate configurations with operator-choice TODO markers.

## 5. Host-side artifacts NOT in this PR (operator activation needed)

The following edits are on host paths outside the council git repo and must be applied manually by the operator after reviewing this ratification. Draft content is embedded below so the activating session does not need to re-derive it from drop #62.

### 5.1 LiteLLM gateway config — additive routes

Append these entries to `model_list` in the host-side LiteLLM config file:

```yaml
  # Local models via TabbyAPI (second instance, Hermes 3 8B on :5001)
  - model_name: local-fast-hermes
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-EXL3-5.00bpw
      api_base: http://172.18.0.1:5001/v1
      api_key: "dummy"
      extra_body:
        chat_template_kwargs:
          enable_thinking: false

  - model_name: coding-hermes
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-EXL3-5.00bpw
      api_base: http://172.18.0.1:5001/v1
      api_key: "dummy"
      extra_body:
        chat_template_kwargs:
          enable_thinking: false

  - model_name: reasoning-hermes
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-EXL3-5.00bpw
      api_base: http://172.18.0.1:5001/v1
      api_key: "dummy"
      extra_body:
        chat_template_kwargs:
          enable_thinking: true
```

And append these fallback entries to `litellm_settings.fallbacks`:

```yaml
    - reasoning-hermes: [reasoning, claude-sonnet, claude-opus]
    - coding-hermes: [coding, claude-sonnet, claude-opus]
    - local-fast-hermes: [local-fast, gemini-flash, claude-haiku]
```

The `*-hermes` routes fall back to the existing Qwen `local-fast`/`coding`/`reasoning` routes first, which is the key "parallel" property: when Hermes is down, the council degrades to Qwen instead of cloud. This is the drop #56 v3 assumption.

### 5.2 TabbyAPI second-instance config file (new, host-side draft)

Place at the `tabbyAPI/` sibling checkout root as `config.yml.hermes-8b`:

```yaml
# Hermes 3 Llama 3.1 8B EXL3 5.0bpw — tabbyAPI draft config (parallel pivot)
#
# LRR Phase 5a (unified sequence UP-7a). This file is the staged
# config for the SECOND TabbyAPI instance serving Hermes 3 8B
# alongside the existing Qwen 3.5-9B instance on port 5000.
#
# DO NOT swap in this config as config.yml on the main instance.
# Instead, the new systemd unit `tabbyapi-hermes8b.service` will
# run a second TabbyAPI process pointing at this file via a
# `--config` override.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Hermes 3 8B EXL3 5.0bpw weights at
#      tabbyAPI/models/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-EXL3-5.0bpw/
#   2. GPU allocation decision per the drop-in TODO in
#      systemd/units/tabbyapi-hermes8b.service.d/gpu-pin.conf
#   3. LiteLLM config reloaded with the three additive routes per
#      docs/research/2026-04-15-drop-62-option-c-ratification.md §5.1
#
# Exit criteria (inherited from LRR Phase 5):
#   - Consent-revocation drill passes under <2s end-to-end
#   - Speech-continuity drill: zero dropped frames during long gen
#   - CAPABLE-tier preservation: no cloud fallback for voice

### 5.3 Weight download (operator action)

The Hermes 3 8B EXL3 5.0bpw weights do not exist on disk. The operator must either self-quantize from a reference fp16 download or pull an existing community quant. Disk cost: ~5 GB. Approximate download time: minutes on a fast link.

## 6. Activation sequence (after operator weight drop)

1. Operator pulls or self-quants Hermes 3 8B EXL3 5.0bpw weights into the `tabbyAPI/models/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B-EXL3-5.0bpw/` directory.
2. Operator copies the §5.2 draft to `tabbyAPI/config.yml.hermes-8b`.
3. Operator decides GPU allocation (see §4.2 TODO) and edits `systemd/units/tabbyapi-hermes8b.service.d/gpu-pin.conf` accordingly.
4. Operator runs `scripts/install-units.sh` to install the new unit, then `systemctl --user daemon-reload`.
5. Operator appends the §5.1 routes to the host-side LiteLLM config and restarts the `litellm-council` container.
6. Operator starts `tabbyapi-hermes8b.service` and verifies via `curl http://localhost:5001/v1/models`.
7. Operator runs the consent-revocation drill and speech-continuity drill (LRR Phase 5 exit criteria, inherited).
8. Session opens `cond-phase-a-prime-hermes-8b-002` in the research registry (requires LRR Phase 1 shipped first) and files `DEVIATION-037` with the 8B pivot rationale.
9. `conversation_pipeline.py` dispatch on `active_model_family` is added in a separate DEVIATION-gated PR (this file is currently FROZEN under the active research condition; touching it requires the new condition opened in step 8).

## 7. What option C does NOT do

- Does not open UP-7a. The 8B pivot is only possible once LRR Phase 1 (research registry) has landed because `DEVIATION-037` depends on the registry.
- Does not download weights. Operator action.
- Does not touch `conversation_pipeline.py`. That file is FROZEN; dispatch code needs a new research condition first.
- Does not update the host-side LiteLLM config live. The additive routes are drafted above; operator appends and reloads.
- Does not resolve drop #62 §10 questions #2–#10. Those remain open.
- Does not commit to a specific GPU allocation. The scaffolding drop-in carries a TODO.

## 8. Trace

- Drop #54 (speculative Bayesian analysis)
- Drop #55 (grounded single-axis Bayesian analysis)
- Drop #56 v3 (novelty + platform value correction; established the 70B-unreachable axiom bound)
- Drop #57 T2.6 (8B parallel as a tactic)
- Drop #58 (HSEA thesis; I4 drafters proposed)
- Drop #59 (audit of drop #58)
- Drop #60 + #61 (HSEA epic spec + plan)
- Drop #62 §4 (three options; (c) recommended)
- Delta 2026-04-15T04:45Z inflection (HSEA + fold-in shipped summary + "For beta (PR #819 author)" guidance cross-referenced above)
- **This doc:** drop #62 §10 question #1 confirmed → option (c)

— End of ratification record.
