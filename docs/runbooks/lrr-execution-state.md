# LRR Execution State Runbook

**Scope:** operator-facing single-page status for the Livestream Research Ready (LRR) epic.
**Authoritative surface:** `origin/main` and local infrastructure state as of **2026-04-16**.
**Regeneration:** this doc should be rewritten whenever a phase closes or substrate state changes. Last rewrite: beta (LRR single-session takeover), 2026-04-16.

---

## Headline

Substrate decision is **resolved**. Scenarios 1 (Qwen baseline) + 2 (OLMo-3 parallel backend) are shipped. The second half of the epic (Phases 6-10) is now unblocked; critical-path items are Phase 6 joint constitutional PR and Phase 8/9 engineering work.

## Substrate scenario 1+2 state (Phase 5)

| Track | Infrastructure | Exit test | Follow-ups |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scenario 1 — Qwen3.5-9B + RIFTS | Qwen3.5-9B live on TabbyAPI `:5000`, `local-fast`/`coding`/`reasoning` routes | RIFTS harness + baseline run complete (PR #934) | Scale labeling, comparison vs OLMo baselines |
| Scenario 2 — OLMo-3-7B parallel | TabbyAPI-olmo live on `:5001` (GPU 1 pinned), `local-research-instruct` route (PR #932 + #933) | `curl` smoke test returns `ROUTE_OK` | Three-variant (SFT/DPO/RLVR) swap — deferred (queue #212.3); cycle 2 full run — awaits operator |

## Observability posture (post-2026-04-16 recovery)

| Signal | State |
|---|---|
| LiteLLM → Langfuse callback | ✅ wired (success + failure) |
| MinIO `events/` retention | 3d lifecycle (was 14d; tightened during inode crisis) |
| `LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` | 0.1 (was 0.3) |
| `/data` inode usage | 37% (21.7M cap) |
| ClickHouse `max_concurrent_queries_for_user` | 16 (was 8 — raised during recovery spike) |
| GPU thermal alert | ✅ fixed (was silently broken; orphan metric rename today) |
| Qdrant p99 latency alert | ✅ fixed (was silently broken; orphan metric rename today) |
| Langfuse observations/hour | 46K+ post-fix |
| Failed jobs (legacy backlog) | ingestion-queue=100K, otel=61K — terminal from inode-exhaustion era |
