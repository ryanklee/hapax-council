# Volitional Grounded Director — Master Execution Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans for inline execution, or superpowers:subagent-driven-development for per-task dispatch. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Close the volition→composition→legibility loop on the studio compositor — replace three unsupervised shufflers with a grounded director that reads a structured perceptual field (all existing classifiers) and emits directorial intent through the existing AffordancePipeline, with multi-rate hierarchy, legibility-on-frame, and research observability.

**Architecture:** Director emits `DirectorIntent` + `CompositionalImpingement`s (never direct capability invocations). Pipeline recruits compositional affordances (camera.hero.*, fx.family.*, overlay.foreground.*, youtube.direction.*, attention.winner.*). Twitch (4 s deterministic) + Narrative (20 s grounded-LLM) + Structural (150 s grounded-LLM) rates. Cairo legibility surfaces render stance/activity/captions/chat-legend/grounding-ticker.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.12 / Pydantic v2 / LiteLLM (Command R 08-2024) / Cairo / GStreamer / existing AffordancePipeline / Qdrant / Langfuse / Prometheus.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-volitional-grounded-director-design.md`

**Branch:** `volitional-director` (PR #1017)

Execution is serial. Each phase ends with: tests pass, commit, compositor restart + visual smoke, mark phase complete in this master plan, continue.

## Execution protocol

**Before each phase:**
1. Read the phase plan end-to-end once.
2. Check that no prerequisite phase has regressed (previous phases' tests still pass).
3. Pull latest from origin/main and rebase volitional-director if needed (only if origin/main moved).

**During each phase:**
1. Follow the task steps verbatim.
2. Use TDD: write failing test → verify fail → implement → verify pass → commit.
3. Run ruff + pyright before commit. Fix any issue.
4. Commit with a clear message; no `--no-verify`.

**After each phase:**
1. Run `systemctl --user restart studio-compositor.service` (or `rebuild-services.timer` waits).
2. Capture a 1920×1080 frame from `/dev/video42`.
3. Visual smoke: confirm nothing regressed (reverie still shows content, cameras still feed, overlays still present).
4. Mark the phase's checkbox in this file; append a one-line note to the Changelog at the bottom.

**Rollback:** per-phase rollback procedures live in the spec §9. Runtime flags: `HAPAX_DIRECTOR_MODEL_LEGACY=1` (restores pre-epic director), `HAPAX_COMPOSITOR_LAYOUT=default-legacy.json` (restores pre-epic layout). Both implemented as part of Phase 1 and Phase 4 respectively.

## Branch discipline

- **Single branch for the whole epic:** `volitional-director` / PR #1017.
- Commit granularity: one commit per logical step within a phase; multiple commits per phase acceptable; phase ends with a squashed-summary commit OR a clean chain of commits (pick per-phase based on complexity).
- No branch switches except to pull/rebase origin/main.
- Force-push only to clean up commit history within the epic — never to rewrite history a reviewer might have already seen. Prefer new commits.

## Audit gate

Before Phase 1 begins: perform the self-audit described in the writing-plans skill:
1. Spec coverage — each phase ties back to a numbered section of the design spec.
2. Placeholder scan — no TBDs, no "similar to Task N"; each phase plan contains complete code blocks for each step.
3. Type consistency — Pydantic model field names used in Phase 1 match those referenced in Phases 2-7.
4. Open questions — surface any findings from the audit that change the phase plans; fix inline.

Audit fixes land before Phase 1's first commit.

## Epic status

**Core implementations:** all 9 phases shipped on branch `volitional-director` / PR #1017 across 15 commits. Total ~3200 lines of new code + 10+ test files + 10 spec/plan documents.

**Deferred follow-ups** (noted in individual phase plans; ship when operator schedules):
- Phase 3c: Director-side CompositionalImpingement emission to the pipeline. Requires operator decision on whether compositional affordances live in daimonion's pipeline or a new compositor-side pipeline instance.
- Phase 5 StructuralDirector (150s cadence LLM) + narrative cadence shift 8s→20s. Deferred because cadence change is behaviourally load-bearing and wants a dedicated rehearsal window.
- Phase 6 hot-swap wiring in `state.py::state_reader_loop`. The predicate + layout exist; wiring the trigger is ~5 lines once operator blesses the layout-swap mechanism.
- Phase 9: actual 30-minute rehearsal run with `scripts/rehearsal-capture.sh`, followed by filling in the audit-report template and opening `cond-phase-a-volitional-director-001` via `scripts/research-registry.py open`.

**Verification:** 75 new unit tests across the epic's shipped phases, all green. Two pre-existing unrelated failures in `test_compositor_wiring.py` (captions source on main's layout) are not introduced by this epic.

## Resumption notes (for the session that continues this epic)

**Where we are:** commits on `volitional-director` through `d9b1fc861`. Phases 0, 1, 2 shipped cleanly. Test suites green (Phase 1: 31 tests; Phase 2: 14 tests; total 45). Two pre-existing unrelated test failures in `test_compositor_wiring.py` (expected set lacks `captions` but origin/main layout has it; not our fault, not blocking).

**What the running system looks like now:**
- Director emits `DirectorIntent` (behind the scenes — LLM still returns `{activity, react}` until Phase 3 teaches it the richer shape).
- `~/hapax-state/stream-experiment/director-intent.jsonl` accumulates one line per tick.
- `/dev/shm/hapax-director/narrative-state.json` exists with current stance/activity.
- Director prompt contains `## Perceptual Field` block with full structured JSON of contact-mic / MIDI / vision / IR / stimmung / album / chat-aggregate / presence / context signals.
- Legacy flag `HAPAX_DIRECTOR_MODEL_LEGACY=1` bypasses new behavior cleanly.

**Next up: Phase 3.** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-17-phase-3-compositional-recruitment.md` is the executable plan. Scope:
- Create compositional capability catalog (camera.hero.*, fx.family.*, overlay.foreground.*, youtube.direction.*, attention.winner.*) under `shared/affordances/compositional/`.
- Seed Qdrant `affordances` collection with the catalog.
- Create `agents/studio_compositor/compositional_consumer.py` that translates pipeline recruitments into compositor mutations.
- Demote `random_mode` and `_reload_slot_from_playlist` to fallbacks; retire `objective_hero_switcher` direct-dispatch path.
- Wire attention-bid dispatch to recruitment.

Phase 3 is the largest remaining phase. Allow ~2-3 hours of uninterrupted execution context.

**Phases 4-9** are smaller and well-scoped per their plans. Phase 8 (DEVIATION record + new condition declaration) must ship before Phase 9 rehearsal attempts activation.

**Not-yet-done that's external to this plan:** the dirty state in the `hapax-council` main worktree (78 D-staged files from a prior aborted cleanup) remains untouched. It's unrelated to this epic. Operator should either `git restore` those paths or investigate before the next main-worktree push.

**Rehearsal timing:** per `docs/research/2026-04-17-expected-behavior-at-launch.md §4`, the first real live attempt goes via 30-minute private rehearsal. Phase 9 owns this gate. Until Phases 3-7 land, the system runs in Phase 0-2 configuration (PerceptualField in prompt, no compositional recruitment yet, no multi-rate, no new legibility surfaces).
