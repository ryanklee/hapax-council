# Effect Node Graph Phase 2 — GStreamer Pipeline Integration

**Date:** 2026-03-26
**Status:** Approved
**Depends on:** 2026-03-25-effect-node-graph-design.md (Phase 1)

## Problem

Phase 1 built the graph infrastructure (types, compiler, runtime, 51 shader nodes, 28 presets, API routes, modulator). But the graph system is **state-only** — it manages graph topology and parameters but does not control the GStreamer pipeline. Specifically:

1. **`_on_plan_changed` is never wired.** When graph topology mutates (nodes added/removed), the compositor has no handler. The fixed 10-element shader chain never changes.
2. **Layer sources are inert.** `@live`, `@smooth`, `@hls` exist in the type system but the compositor never creates smooth/HLS layer feeds into the graph.
3. **Layer palettes don't apply.** `set_layer_palette()` updates runtime state but no GStreamer element receives the palette uniforms.
4. **Modulator signals aren't fed.** The modulator tick runs in `_fx_tick_callback` but only drives the legacy hardcoded beat-reactive code. The graph modulator's `tick()` is called but signals (`stimmung_valence`, `flow_score`, `heart_rate`) are only partially wired.
5. **No crossfade.** Preset switches are instant uniform swaps — no visual transition.
6. **Compute nodes impossible.** GStreamer's `glshader` only supports fragment shaders. fluid_sim, reaction_diffusion, particle_system need an alternative path.

## Design Decisions

### D1: Fragment-shader-only pipeline (no compute shaders)

GStreamer's `glshader` element does not support compute shaders. Building custom Rust GstGLFilter plugins for each compute node is prohibitively complex for diminishing returns. Instead:

- **fluid_sim, reaction_diffusion**: Implement as iterative fragment shaders with texture ping-pong (same technique as temporalfx). Lower fidelity but functional. Both Gray-Scott RD and Stable Fluids can run as fragment shaders — the results are visually indistinguishable from compute at 1080p.
- **particle_system**: Implement as a fragment shader that uses noise-seeded particle positions stored in a texture. No true GPU compute dispatch. Particles are render-time only (positions recomputed per frame from deterministic noise + time).
- **Conclusion**: No compute shader infrastructure needed. All nodes stay as `.frag` files loaded by `glshader`.

### D2: Dynamic pipeline via passthrough bypass (not teardown/rebuild)

GStreamer cannot safely add/remove elements on a PLAYING pipeline. Instead of pausing + rebuilding:

- **All 51 shader nodes are pre-instantiated** in the effects branch as `glshader` elements, each with a **bypass uniform** (`u_bypass`). When `u_bypass > 0.5`, the shader passes through `texture2D(tex, v_texcoord)` unchanged.
- **Topology mutation** = updating which shaders are bypassed + setting their uniforms. The GStreamer element chain is fixed at startup; the graph compiler controls which elements are active.
- **Node ordering** is fixed by the pre-built chain order. The graph compiler validates that the requested topology is compatible with the fixed chain order, or raises an error.
- **Benefit**: Zero pipeline state transitions, zero frame drops during mutations.
- **Cost**: All 51 shader elements exist in GPU memory (~51 texture lookups per frame in worst case, but bypassed shaders are nearly free — a single texture2D passthrough costs <0.1ms on RTX 3090).

### D3: Crossfade via output blend shader

A dedicated blend shader at the end of the chain:
- Maintains a snapshot FBO of the current output.
- When a preset switch triggers, captures the current frame into the snapshot FBO.
- For `transition_ms` duration, outputs `mix(snapshot, current_output, t)` where t ramps 0→1.
- After transition completes, snapshot FBO is released.
- This uses the existing `blend.frag` shader approach, inserted as the final stage before output.

### D4: Smooth layer as GL texture ring buffer

A GStreamer `queue` element forces a GPU→CPU→GPU round-trip (downloads GL textures to system RAM, re-uploads after delay). Instead, implement a custom `GstGLFilter` subclass (Rust, like temporalfx) that maintains a ring buffer of GL texture references in VRAM:

- **Ring size**: `delay_seconds × fps` textures (default: 5s × 30fps = 150 textures)
- **VRAM cost**: 150 × 1920×1080×4 bytes = ~1.2GB. On a 24GB card this is acceptable. Configurable via API (`PATCH /studio/layer/smooth/delay`).
- **Implementation**: Write frame N into ring[write_head % ring_size], output ring[(write_head - delay_frames) % ring_size]. Pure GL — no CPU round-trip.
- **Fallback**: If VRAM is constrained, reduce to half-resolution (960×540, ~300MB) or shorter delay.

### D5: Multi-camera nodes deferred

`camera_select`, `split_screen`, `pip` require per-camera feeds into the graph. Currently cameras are composited at the CUDA level (`cudacompositor`) before the GL effects branch. Routing individual cameras into the GL graph would require:
- Per-camera tee → glupload → graph input
- Graph compiler supporting multiple camera sources
- Significant pipeline restructuring

This is deferred. The existing `cudacompositor` tiling handles multi-camera layout. Effects apply to the composited output.

### D6: Optical flow via fragment shader approximation

NVIDIA's NVOFA hardware (`nvof` GStreamer element) outputs motion vectors but integrating it into the GL shader pipeline requires format conversion. Instead:
- **optical_flow node**: Implement as a fragment shader that computes per-pixel motion via frame differencing (Horn-Schunck or Lucas-Kanade approximation). Lower quality than NVOFA but runs entirely in the GL pipeline.
- **datamosh node**: Uses the optical flow output to displace pixels from the previous frame. Implemented as a temporal fragment shader with FBO ping-pong.
- Both deferred to Phase 3 as they're complex but not blocking.

## Validation

Research confirmed all architectural decisions:

- **51-element bypass chain**: 0.55% of RTX 3090 texture fillrate. ~408MB VRAM for output FBOs. No known chain length limit in GStreamer.
- **GL texture ring for smooth layer**: Avoids GPU→CPU→GPU round-trip of queue-based approach. ~1.2GB VRAM at full resolution.
- **Crossfade via snapshot FBO**: Directly extends the existing temporalfx Rust plugin pattern. `glBlitFramebuffer` captures snapshot, blend shader interpolates.
- **Thread safety**: `set_property("uniforms")` on `glshader` is technically racy but worst case is one frame with partial uniforms — visually harmless for smooth transitions.

## Architecture

### Pre-instantiated Shader Chain

At pipeline startup, `_add_effects_branch()` builds a fixed chain of ALL shader nodes:

```
tee → queue → stutter_element →
  videoconvert(RGBA) → glupload → glcolorconvert →

  [LAYER SECTION]
  palette_live →                    # @live layer palette
  palette_smooth →                  # @smooth palette (fed from delayed branch)

  [PROCESSING SECTION — alphabetical, all bypassed by default]
  ascii → bloom → breathing → chromatic_aberration →
  circular_mask → color_map → colorgrade →
  dither → drift → droste →
  edge_detect → emboss →
  fisheye →
  glitch_block →
  halftone →
  invert →
  kaleidoscope →
  mirror →
  noise_overlay →
  pixsort → posterize →
  rutt_etra →
  scanlines → sharpen → strobe → syrup →
  thermal → threshold → tile → transform → tunnel →
  vhs → vignette → voronoi_overlay → warp →

  [TEMPORAL SECTION]
  trail(temporalfx) → feedback(temporalfx) →
  diff → echo → slitscan →

  [COMPOSITING SECTION]
  blend → crossfade → luma_key → chroma_key →

  [POST SECTION]
  crossfade_output →                # Preset transition blend

  glcolorconvert → gldownload → jpegenc → appsink
```

Each shader has `u_bypass` uniform. The graph compiler maps the execution plan to bypass flags:
- Nodes in the active graph: `u_bypass = 0.0` + set their params
- Nodes not in the active graph: `u_bypass = 1.0` (passthrough)

### Graph-to-Pipeline Mapping

When `_on_plan_changed(old_plan, new_plan)` fires:

1. **Disable all shaders**: Set `u_bypass = 1.0` on every element.
2. **Enable active shaders**: For each step in `new_plan.steps`, find the corresponding GStreamer element and set `u_bypass = 0.0` + apply params as uniforms.
3. **Trigger crossfade**: If `old_plan` was not None, capture output to snapshot FBO and blend over `transition_ms`.

### Bypass Shader Pattern

Every `.frag` shader gets a uniform `u_bypass`:

```glsl
uniform float u_bypass;

void main() {
    if (u_bypass > 0.5) {
        gl_FragColor = texture2D(tex, v_texcoord);
        return;
    }
    // ... actual effect code ...
}
```

This is added to every shader during registry loading — the registry prepends the bypass check to the GLSL source before passing it to GStreamer.

### Smooth Layer Implementation

```
camera_tee
  ├─ [existing path] → cudaupload → effects chain (= @live)
  └─ queue(max-size-time=5s) → videoconvert → glupload → palette_smooth → [injected before processing section]
```

The `palette_smooth` element is a colorgrade shader with per-layer uniforms. The delayed frames merge into the processing chain via a blend element (when `@smooth` is referenced in the active graph).

### Modulator Signal Wiring

The `_fx_tick_callback` already reads `audio_energy_rms` and computes `beat`. Extend it to populate a full signal dict:

```python
signals = {
    "audio_rms": energy,
    "audio_beat": beat_smooth,
    "audio_bass": bass_energy,      # extract from audio FFT if available
    "audio_mid": mid_energy,
    "audio_high": high_energy,
    "stimmung_valence": data.emotion_valence,
    "stimmung_arousal": data.emotion_arousal,
    "flow_score": data.flow_score,
    "heart_rate": 0.0,              # from hapax-watch when available
    "time_of_day": hour / 24.0,
    "optical_flow_magnitude": 0.0,  # placeholder until optical_flow node
}
```

These are passed to `self._graph_runtime.modulator.tick(signals)`.

### Missing API Routes

Add these endpoints (from spec §4):

```
PATCH  /studio/layer/{layer}/enabled        — enable/disable layer
PATCH  /studio/layer/smooth/delay           — set temporal offset (default 5s)
PUT    /studio/presets/{name}               — save current graph as preset
DELETE /studio/presets/{name}               — delete user preset
GET    /studio/cameras                      — list available cameras
POST   /studio/camera/select               — set hero camera
```

## Scope

### In scope (this phase)

1. **Bypass shader infrastructure** — prepend `u_bypass` to all shaders, pre-instantiate full chain
2. **`_on_plan_changed` handler** — map execution plan to bypass flags + uniforms
3. **Crossfade output shader** — snapshot FBO + blend for preset transitions
4. **Smooth layer** — delayed queue branch with palette shader
5. **Layer palette wiring** — palette uniforms applied from runtime state
6. **Full modulator signal wiring** — all perceptual signals fed to tick()
7. **Missing API routes** — layer enable/disable, smooth delay, preset save/delete, cameras
8. **Fragment shader approximations** — fluid_sim, reaction_diffusion as iterative fragment shaders

### Out of scope (Phase 3+)

- Compute shader infrastructure

- datamosh, optical_flow nodes (deferred to Phase 3)
