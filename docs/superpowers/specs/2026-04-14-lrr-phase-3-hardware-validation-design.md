# LRR Phase 3 — Hardware Migration Validation + Hermes 3 Preparation

**Epic:** Livestream Research Ready
**Phase:** 3 of 11
**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Dependency:** Phase 2 complete (shipped in PRs #797, #802, #805).
**Session:** alpha (resumed after operator directive "do everything we can sans Hermes prep completion")

## 0. Motivation + operator correction

The original Phase 3 design (`livestream-research-ready-epic-design.md` §"Phase 3 — Hardware Migration Validation + Hermes 3 Preparation") assumed the X670E motherboard install was a blocking prerequisite for most of Phase 3's work. Beta's verification pass on 2026-04-14 (see `~/.cache/hapax/relay/context/2026-04-14-beta-phase-3-supplement-verified-preconditions.md`) — triggered by operator correction "why are we waiting for the X670E? Don't we have almost everything on board this rig other than increased ram and mobo itself?" — demonstrated that **only items 4, 10, and 11 are truly hardware-gated on the new motherboard**:

**This PR (Phase 3 PR #1) covers items 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 plus documented rollback procedures.** Items 0, 3, 4, 5 are run as operational verification and findings are added to §6 of this spec in a follow-up commit. Item 6 (self-quantization) is deferred as Phase 3 PR #2 per operator direction ("do everything we can sans Hermes prep completion"). Items 10 and 11 remain as Phase 3 PR #3 to land after the X670E install window.

## 1. Scope (this PR, items 1 + 2 + 7 + 8 + 9)

### 1.1 Item 1 — Partition reconciliation α → γ

**Current (Option α):**
- `tabbyapi.service`: no explicit CUDA env vars. CUDA default `FASTEST_FIRST` ranks the 3090 (~17.8 TFLOPS FP32) as cuda:0, config.yml has no `gpu_split` so exllamav3 loads single-GPU on cuda:0 → Qwen3.5-9B resident on the 3090 alone.
- `hapax-dmn.service`: no explicit CUDA env vars. Same FASTEST_FIRST ordering → cuda:0 = 3090 → faster-whisper STT + embedding co-tenant on the 3090.

**Target (Option γ):**
- `tabbyapi.service`: `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` — both GPUs visible for layer-split
- `hapax-dmn.service`: `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` — pinned to 5060 Ti

Both unit files are shipped in this PR as repo-tracked drop-ins at:

- `systemd/units/tabbyapi.service.d/gpu-pin.conf`
- `systemd/units/hapax-dmn.service.d/gpu-pin.conf`

`install-units.sh` is extended in this PR to symlink `*.service.d/` directories into `~/.config/systemd/user/` (previously the script only handled top-level unit files). See § 2 for the install-units.sh extension.

**VRAM math under Option γ** (per beta's supplement §1.4):

| GPU | Residents | Total | Headroom |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5060 Ti (sm_120, 16 GiB) | compositor 3.3 + imagination 0.3 + hapax-dmn 3.4 + Hermes overflow 2.75 + faster-whisper STT 2.5 | 12.25 GiB | 3.25 GiB |
| 3090 (sm_86, 24 GiB) | Hermes 3 layers 0-76 23.5 + activations + KV cache | ~24 GiB | ~0.1 GiB |

**The 3090 is tight.** If Hermes 3's actual VRAM overshoots the spec's 23.5 GB, there is no room. Contingency: drop to 2.5 bpw (tighter quant) or `max_seq_len=2048`. Mitigation plan: the `config.yml.hermes-draft` shipped in this PR uses `max_seq_len=4096` (not 8192 as the original Hermes 3 plan specified) to leave ~0.3 GiB of slack.

### 1.2 Item 2 — Driver + CUDA verification

Beta verified at 2026-04-14T15:30Z:

- Driver: **590.48.01** (matches alpha.yaml session 1 state; pinned in pacman.conf per `feedback_nvidia_595_crash.md`)
- CUDA: **12.8** (via PyTorch 2.9.0+cu128 wheel)
- `nvidia-smi -L` → both GPUs listed
- Direct PyTorch matmul test on both devices under `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` + `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`:
  - `cuda:0` = "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti" sm_120, 4096² fp16 matmul in 327 ms
  - `cuda:1` = "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090" sm_86, 4096² fp16 matmul no errors
- No warnings beyond the benign `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` deprecation notice

**Conclusion:** the exllamav3 "seems to work™" caveat for Blackwell sm_120 is empirically confirmed working on this rig at the PyTorch matmul kernel level. The full systemd-integrated path (TabbyAPI loading Qwen3.5-9B on the 5060 Ti) remains to be verified as part of the alpha-side precondition re-run referenced in `~/.cache/hapax/relay/context/2026-04-14-lrr-phase-3-prestaged-artifacts.md` Stage 1 Task 1.3.

### 1.3 Item 7 — TabbyAPI config draft (Hermes 3)

Ships as `~/projects/tabbyAPI/config.yml.hermes-draft` (local tabbyAPI repo, not active). The draft is committed to the upstream-clone's local git but NOT pushed to `theroyallab/tabbyAPI` per the `.git/info/exclude` pattern for upstream-clones.

Key differences from the current active `config.yml`:

- `model_name: Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-70B-EXL3-3.0bpw` (replaces `Qwen3.5-9B-exl3-5.00bpw`)
- `gpu_split: [2.75, 23.5]` — **CORRECTED from original Hermes 3 plan's `[23.5, 2.75]`**. The original order would OOM the 5060 Ti immediately (tries to put 23.5 GB on a 15.5 GB card). Beta's PyTorch verification (§1.2) pinned the device-index-to-card mapping: process index 0 = 5060 Ti, process index 1 = 3090.
- `cache_mode: Q8` — down from `4,4` (Q4 KV). Q8 KV is slightly larger but safer for 70B first-load.
- `cache_size: 4096` + `max_seq_len: 4096` — pulled back from the original plan's 8192 to leave ~0.3 GiB slack on GPU 1's ~0.1 GiB headroom under Option γ.
- `chunk_size: 2048` — unchanged from current Qwen config
- `inline_model_loading: false` — unchanged

### 1.4 Item 8 — TabbyAPI systemd `TimeoutStartSec` 120 → 180

`systemd/units/tabbyapi.service` bumped from `TimeoutStartSec=120` → `180`. Qwen3.5-9B EXL3 loads in ~40-50 s; Hermes 3 70B EXL3 3.0bpw (~26 GB) is expected to load in ~70-90 s based on comparable 70B EXL3 benchmarks. The 120-second cap is tight enough that a cold-cache first-load from the 30 safetensors shards could hit it. 180 s gives 60 s of cushion without being so loose that a genuinely-broken model load escapes the watchdog.

Rollback: just change `TimeoutStartSec=180` back to `120`.

### 1.5 Item 9 — Rollback plan

See §5 for the full rollback procedure.

## 2. `install-units.sh` extension for `.service.d/` drop-ins

Previously the script iterated `*.service *.timer *.target *.path` under `systemd/units/` and symlinked each into `~/.config/systemd/user/`. It did NOT handle `*.service.d/` drop-in directories. Existing drop-ins under `systemd/units/audio-recorder.service.d/` and `systemd/units/contact-mic-recorder.service.d/` were silently not installed — a latent gap.

Phase 3 adds `tabbyapi.service.d/` and `hapax-dmn.service.d/`, both of which MUST be active for the partition reconciliation to take effect. Extending the script now fixes both the new drop-ins and the latent existing ones as a single change.

The extension:

1. After the main unit-file link loop, walk `systemd/units/*.service.d/` directories.
2. For each found, ensure `$DEST_DIR/<service>.service.d/` exists (as a real directory, not symlink — this matches how the existing tabbyapi.service.d/ works on disk today).
3. Symlink every `*.conf` file inside into the matching destination `.d/` directory.
4. Report counts + trigger `daemon-reload` if anything changed.

Regression pin: `tests/test_install_units_sweep_pin.py` extended to assert that the script walks `*.service.d/` directories and links `*.conf` files into the matching destination `.d/` dir.

## 3. Rollback procedures (item 9)

### 3.1 Revert Option γ → Option α (partition)

If Hermes 3 fails to load or benchmarks below threshold, remove the two Phase 3 drop-ins entirely. The base units have no CUDA env vars, so CUDA default FASTEST_FIRST restores cuda:0 = 3090 and both services return to their Option α single-GPU-on-3090 placement.

```bash
# 1. Remove both drop-ins from the live systemd directory
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/tabbyapi.service.d/gpu-pin.conf
rm ~/.config/systemd/user/hapax-dmn.service.d/gpu-pin.conf

# 2. Reload + restart
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart tabbyapi.service
systemctl --user restart hapax-dmn.service

# 3. Verify rollback
nvidia-smi  # confirm: 3090 has tabbyapi + hapax-dmn; 5060 Ti has compositor only
```

The repo-tracked drop-in files under `systemd/units/*.service.d/` can be left in place — a subsequent `install-units.sh` run will re-link them and bring Option γ back. To lock in the reversion across install-units.sh runs, revert the PR on main and re-run `install-units.sh`.

### 3.2 Revert Hermes 3 → Qwen3.5-9B (config)

If the config swap is also applied:

```bash
# 1. Revert tabbyAPI config
cd ~/projects/tabbyAPI
git checkout -- config.yml  # discard local Hermes 3 changes

# 2. Restart tabbyapi
systemctl --user restart tabbyapi.service

# 3. Verify
curl -s http://localhost:5000/v1/models | jq '.data[0].id'
# expected: "Qwen3.5-9B-exl3-5.00bpw"
```

### 3.3 Revert systemd timeout change

```bash
cd ~/projects/hapax-council
git revert <commit-sha-of-this-pr>  # or manually edit systemd/units/tabbyapi.service
bash systemd/scripts/install-units.sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

The `TimeoutStartSec=180` value is forward-compatible with smaller models — no functional regression on Qwen, just an unused 60 s of slack. So the rollback is only needed if there's a genuine reason to restore the 120 s value.

## 4. Exit criteria

- [x] Partition drop-ins at `systemd/units/tabbyapi.service.d/gpu-pin.conf` and `systemd/units/hapax-dmn.service.d/gpu-pin.conf` present and correct
- [x] `install-units.sh` extended to install drop-in directories
- [x] `tabbyapi.service` `TimeoutStartSec` raised to 180
- [x] `config.yml.hermes-draft` staged at `~/projects/tabbyAPI/` (local-only commit, not pushed to upstream)
- [x] Rollback procedure documented (this spec §3)
- [ ] Alpha re-runs formal sm_120 precondition check at systemd-integrated level (follow-up)
- [ ] PSU combined-load stress test documented in spec §6 (follow-up operational task)
- [ ] Thermal validation under combined load (follow-up operational task)
- [ ] `sudo lspci -vvs` PCIe link width output recorded (follow-up operational task; operator now considers this unblocked)
- [ ] Regression test pinning gpu_split ordering + drop-in presence (this PR)

## 5. Risks

- **3090 headroom is tight.** GPU 1 has ~0.1 GiB free after Hermes 3 + activations + KV cache. Any overshoot on actual VRAM vs the 23.5 GB spec number forces fallback to 2.5 bpw or `max_seq_len=2048`. Contingency documented in §1.3.
- **Partition activation requires a service restart.** Activating Option γ means restarting both `tabbyapi.service` and `hapax-dmn.service`. The restart window briefly kills local LLM routing (`local-fast`/`coding`/`reasoning`) and voice STT. Schedule during an idle window.
- **Self-quantization (Phase 3 PR #2) is multi-hour.** The 6-12 hour window blocks TabbyAPI from handling simultaneous inference (the 3090 is busy with quant compute). Plan for overnight.
- **X670E install (Phase 3 PR #3) is a separate operator window** (~2026-04-16). Items 4, 10, 11 ship there.

## 6. Operational verification findings

### 6.1 Item 4 — PCIe link width (2026-04-14, pre-mobo baseline)

```
$ sudo lspci -vvs 03:00.0 | grep -E 'LnkCap|LnkSta'   # RTX 5060 Ti
    LnkCap:  Speed 32GT/s, Width x8   (PCIe Gen 5 x8)
    LnkSta:  Speed 8GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (downgraded)
           ^^^^^^^^ PCIe Gen 3 x4 — massively downgraded

$ sudo lspci -vvs 07:00.0 | grep -E 'LnkCap|LnkSta'   # RTX 3090
    LnkCap:  Speed 16GT/s, Width x16  (PCIe Gen 4 x16)
    LnkSta:  Speed 16GT/s, Width x16  — running at full capability
```

**Finding:** The 5060 Ti is running at PCIe Gen 3 x4 (8 GT/s × 4 lanes ≈ 3.94 GB/s) against a PCIe Gen 5 x8 capability (~31.5 GB/s). That's an **8× bandwidth penalty**. This is the B550 chipset slot topology limit — the second x16 slot on this motherboard splits lanes via the chipset and drops to Gen 3 x4 when populated. The 3090 in the primary slot is fine.

**Implication for Option γ / Hermes 3:**
- Layer-split inter-GPU communication (activations between layers 0-76 on 3090 and any overflow slice on 5060 Ti) will use the 5060 Ti's PCIe link, which is 4 GB/s.
- For a 2.75 GiB overflow slice on the 5060 Ti, the activation bandwidth per forward pass is small (~MB, not GB) so the Gen 3 x4 link is **not** the inference bottleneck — the 3090's own SM throughput dominates.
- Model load from disk → 5060 Ti VRAM: 2.75 GiB / 3.94 GB/s ≈ 0.7 s, adds negligible latency to cold start.
- **The downgrade is cosmetically ugly but behaviorally acceptable for Option γ.** It will be re-measured after the X670E install (Phase 3 PR #3) when both slots can deliver full bandwidth.

### 6.2 Item 5 — Thermal baseline (2026-04-14, pre-partition)

Snapshot under nominal compositor + Qwen3.5-9B + hapax-dmn load:

| GPU | Temp | Power | VRAM | Clocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — RTX 5060 Ti | 50 °C | 37 W | 3866 / 16311 MiB | 2947 MHz |
| 1 — RTX 3090 | 74 °C | 240 W | 15581 / 24576 MiB | 1800 MHz |

The 3090 at 74 °C / 240 W is within the safe envelope (TjMax 93 °C, TDP 350 W) under light inference load. Under Option γ with Hermes 3 70B resident, expected steady-state temp is ~80-85 °C and power ~280-320 W — still safe, but thermally hotter than Option α. A true 30-minute sustained-load thermal validation (item 5 full test) is deferred to the next idle window because it requires disrupting active services.

### 6.3 Items 0 + 3 — Deferred to operator-scheduled windows

- **Item 0** (formal systemd-integrated sm_120 test): requires a controlled `systemctl restart tabbyapi` with timing instrumentation. Beta's shell-level PyTorch matmul already confirmed sm_120 works on the 5060 Ti at the kernel level. The systemd-integrated re-verification adds confidence but disrupts local-fast/coding/reasoning routes briefly. **Schedule during operator idle window.**
- **Item 3** (PSU combined-load 30-min stress): requires saturating both GPUs simultaneously for 30 minutes under `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,clocks_throttle_reasons.hw_power_brake_slowdown` monitoring. Heavily disrupts compositor and voice during the test window. **Schedule during operator idle window.**

### 6.4 Item 11 — Brio-operator fps (post-BRIO-swap, Phase 3 PR #3)

Deferred to post-mobo install window when the BRIO replacement lands.

## 7. Handoff implications

Phase 3 PR #1 (this PR) ships the non-runtime-destructive bits. After merge, the operator decides when to apply the partition via `systemctl --user daemon-reload && restart tabbyapi && restart hapax-dmn`. Phase 5 (Hermes 3 actual substrate swap) is unblocked from this PR + the Phase 3 PR #2 self-quantization.

Phase 4 (Condition A collection) can run in parallel with Phase 3's pre-mobo work under the original epic design's time-gating rule — Phase 4 runs on Qwen (current substrate) while Phase 3 prepares Hermes (next substrate).
