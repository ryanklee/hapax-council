# Vocal Chain Imagination Integration — Context Injection + Proactive Utterance

## Summary

Sub-project 3 of 3. Imagination bus fragments influence the voice daemon's conversation pipeline in two ways: low/medium-salience fragments inject into the conversation LLM's context as "Current Thoughts" (shaping what the system says), and high-salience fragments can trigger proactive utterance (the system speaks unprompted when conditions are right).

## Context Injection

The conversation LLM's system prompt gains a dynamic "Current Thoughts" section, populated from the imagination bus's `stream.jsonl` on every conversation turn.

### Source

Read `/dev/shm/hapax-imagination/stream.jsonl` — last 5 lines (most recent fragments). Sub-millisecond read.

### Salience-Graded Framing

Fragments are formatted with salience-dependent framing:

- **salience < 0.4** — "(background)" prefix. Passive context. The LLM sees them but isn't instructed to act on them. Subtle influence on word choice, framing, awareness.
- **salience 0.4-0.6** — "(active thought)" prefix. Actively framed as recent thoughts the system may reference if relevant to conversation. If the operator asks what the system is thinking about, draw from these.
- **salience > 0.6** — these have already escalated to impingements and are handled by the cascade/proactive path. Still included in context for coherence.

### Format

```
## Current Thoughts
These are things you've been thinking about recently.

- (background) The desk has been quiet for a while, weather is clearing.
- (background) The operator's heart rate has been steady at 68 bpm.
- (active thought) A connection between the drift report and the scout evaluation
  for local-llm-coding — both suggest consolidating inference infrastructure.
```

### Integration

Injected via the existing system prompt assembly in the conversation pipeline. No new LLM agent — augments the existing one. Assembled fresh on each conversation turn (not cached).

## Proactive Utterance

When imagination produces something worth saying out loud, the system initiates a conversational turn without being prompted.

### Trigger Path

```
Imagination loop → fragment salience ≥ 0.8 → escalation to impingement (existing)
    → ProactiveGate.should_speak() checks pass
    → generate utterance from fragment narrative + content references
    → speak via existing TTS pipeline
    → MIDI vocal chain already active from same impingement (cross-modal)
```

### Proactive Gate

All conditions must be true:

| Condition | Source | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| High salience | Fragment | `salience >= 0.8` |
| Operator present | Perception state | `activity` not in ("idle", "away", "unknown") |
| Operator not speaking | VAD state | No active voice activity detected |
| Conversational gap | Voice daemon state | Last utterance (either direction) > 30s ago |
| TPN not active | DMN state | `tpn_active == False` |
| Cooldown elapsed | ProactiveGate internal | Last proactive utterance > 120s ago |

### Utterance Generation

The fragment's narrative and content references are formatted as a conversation prompt:

```
You just had a thought worth sharing with the operator. Express it naturally
and concisely — 1-3 sentences. Don't announce that you had a thought; just
share the insight as if continuing a natural conversation.

The thought: {fragment.narrative}

Related content: {resolved content reference summaries}
```

This goes through the normal conversation LLM → TTS pipeline. The MIDI vocal chain is simultaneously active from the same impingement — the voice sounds energized/engaged, not flat.

### Cooldown

120 seconds after a proactive utterance before another can occur. Prevents the system from repeatedly initiating. Resets on operator-initiated conversation (if the operator starts talking, the cooldown clears — the system shouldn't hold back in an active conversation).

## File Layout

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `agents/imagination_context.py` | `format_imagination_context(stream_path) -> str` — read stream.jsonl, format salience-graded prompt section |
| `agents/proactive_gate.py` | `ProactiveGate` class — gate checks for proactive utterance |
| `tests/test_imagination_context.py` | Context formatting, salience grading, empty stream, malformed lines |
| `tests/test_proactive_gate.py` | Each gate condition independently, combined pass/fail, cooldown behavior |

## Reflective Feedback — Audio Field Perception

### General Principle (shared with visual surface)

A surface is not the system's output — it is the complete perceptual field in a modality. The audio surface is the full audio environment: the system's TTS reflected through the room, the MIDI effects chain applied to it, the operator's voice, ambient room sound, music, desk activity — everything the microphone captures. The system hears its own expression IN the environment, not in isolation.

### Audio Field

The microphone input IS the audio field. It captures exactly what the audio environment sounds like from the system's position — the system's voice reflected back through the room, mixed with the operator, mixed with everything else. This is already captured by the voice pipeline (Blue Yeti → PyAudio → 16kHz frames).

The audio field feeds back to the DMN via the existing perception state. The key insight: the system's own TTS output passes through the MIDI effects chain (Evil Pet + S-4), exits the speakers, reflects through the room, and re-enters through the microphone — along with the operator's voice and ambient sound. The DMN already reads perception state (activity, audio_energy, flow_score). The audio field is already being perceived — the system just doesn't currently know which parts of what it hears are its own expression.

### What's Needed

A marker in the perception state indicating when the system is hearing its own output reflected back. The voice daemon already knows when TTS is playing (it sent the audio). A `self_hearing` flag or `tts_active` state in the perception snapshot tells the DMN evaluative tick: "the audio I'm perceiving right now includes my own voice." This lets the DMN evaluate not just what it said (the text), but what it sounded like (the audio field with MIDI effects applied).

### Sensor Integration

```python
"surfaces": {
    "audio": {
        "tts_active": True,          # system is currently hearing its own output
        "audio_energy": 0.42,        # RMS of the full audio field
        "activity": "speech",        # what's happening in the audio field
        "imagination_fragment_id": "abc123",  # which imagination drove this utterance
    },
}
```

This uses existing perception data — no new audio capture needed. The `tts_active` flag is the only new signal, set by the voice daemon when TTS playback begins and cleared when it ends.

## Integration Points (modifications, not new files)

- Voice daemon conversation pipeline: inject `format_imagination_context()` into system prompt assembly
- Imagination loop escalation path: call `ProactiveGate.should_speak()` on high-salience fragments
- Voice daemon TTS path: set `tts_active` flag in perception state during playback

These integration modifications are deferred to a separate voice daemon wiring task after all 3 sub-projects are complete.

## Testing

### imagination_context.py
- Empty stream: returns minimal "Current Thoughts" section with "(mind is quiet)"
- Single fragment: correctly formatted with salience prefix
- Multiple fragments: last 5 only, ordered recent-last
- Salience grading: < 0.4 gets "(background)", 0.4-0.6 gets "(active thought)", > 0.6 gets "(active thought)"
- Malformed lines in stream.jsonl: skipped without error

### proactive_gate.py
- Gate passes when all conditions met
- Gate fails on each individual condition:
  - Salience too low (0.7)
  - Operator not present
  - Operator speaking (VAD active)
  - Recent utterance (< 30s gap)
  - TPN active
  - Cooldown not elapsed
- Cooldown resets on operator-initiated conversation
- Cooldown elapsed after 120s
