# Impingement Cascade Integration — Five Design Specifications

**Status:** Design (implementation specifications)
**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Builds on:** Impingement-Driven Activation Cascade, DMN Architecture, Voice Pipeline Audit

---

## Design Space 1: Spontaneous Speech Path

### Problem
SpeechProductionCapability exists but is dead code. No mechanism to trigger speech without operator address.

### Solution
Wire capability into cognitive loop with impingement consumption.

### Implementation

**Step 1: Instantiate capability in voice daemon** (`__main__.py` ~line 300)
```python
from agents.hapax_voice.capability import SpeechProductionCapability
self._speech_capability = SpeechProductionCapability()
self._cognitive_loop._speech_capability = self._speech_capability
```

**Step 2: Add polling in cognitive loop** (`cognitive_loop.py` after line 183)
```python
if not _pipeline_busy and hasattr(self, '_speech_capability'):
    imp = self._speech_capability.consume_pending()
    if imp is not None:
        # Route directly to LLM generation, bypassing STT
        asyncio.create_task(
            self._pipeline._generate_and_speak_from_impingement(imp)
        )
```

**Step 3: Add impingement-to-speech bridge** (`conversation_pipeline.py`)
```python
async def _generate_and_speak_from_impingement(self, imp: Impingement) -> None:
    """Generate and speak a spontaneous utterance from an impingement."""
    prompt = f"You notice: {imp.content.get('metric', imp.source)}. "
    prompt += f"Strength: {imp.strength:.1f}. "
    prompt += "If this warrants a brief remark to the operator, say it. If not, say nothing."
    # Route through normal LLM → TTS path
```

**Step 4: Turn phase management** — spontaneous speech only during `MUTUAL_SILENCE`. Never interrupt operator or ongoing speech.

### Files Changed
- `agents/hapax_voice/__main__.py` — instantiate + register capability (~10 lines)
- `agents/hapax_voice/cognitive_loop.py` — add polling after line 183 (~15 lines)
- `agents/hapax_voice/conversation_pipeline.py` — add `_generate_and_speak_from_impingement` (~30 lines)

### Tests
- Capability polling returns None when no pending impingements
- Capability polling returns impingement when activated
- Spontaneous speech blocked during non-MUTUAL_SILENCE phases

## Design Space 2: Cross-Daemon Impingement Routing

### Problem
CapabilityRegistry is per-daemon. DMN impingements don't reach voice or fortress daemons.

### Solution
Append-only JSONL log at `/dev/shm/hapax-dmn/impingements.jsonl`. Each daemon polls and filters.

### Implementation

**DMN daemon** (`__main__.py._write_output()`):
```python
IMPINGEMENTS_FILE = DMN_STATE_DIR / "impingements.jsonl"

def _write_output(self) -> None:
    # ... existing buffer + status writes ...
    impingements = self._pulse.drain_impingements()
    if impingements:
        with IMPINGEMENTS_FILE.open("a", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            for imp in impingements:
                f.write(imp.model_dump_json() + "\n")
```

**Fortress daemon** — read and broadcast fortress-relevant impingements (replace current self-generated impingements with DMN-emitted ones).

**Voice daemon** — background coroutine polling every 100-500ms:
```python
async def _impingement_consumer_loop(self):
    cursor = 0
    while self._running:
        for line in read_since(IMPINGEMENTS_FILE, cursor):
            imp = Impingement.model_validate_json(line)
            if self._speech_capability.can_resolve(imp) > 0.0:
                self._speech_capability.activate(imp, level)
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
```

### Latency
- Fortress: 2.0-2.1s (within 2-5s requirement)
- Voice: 100-500ms (meets sub-second requirement)

### Files Changed
- `agents/dmn/__main__.py` — write impingements.jsonl (~10 lines)
- `agents/fortress/__main__.py` — read from JSONL instead of self-generating (~20 lines)
- `agents/hapax_voice/__main__.py` — background consumer loop (~40 lines)

## Design Space 3: Reactive Engine as Cascade Broadcaster

### Problem
The reactive engine (logos/engine/) uses trigger_filter/produce rules. The impingement cascade uses can_resolve/activate capabilities. These are structurally isomorphic but use different protocols.

### Solution
Non-breaking migration: add a ChangeEvent→Impingement converter and RuleCapability wrapper. Existing rules stay as-is.

### Architecture

```
Filesystem event → DirectoryWatcher (unchanged)
    ↓
ChangeEvent (unchanged)
    ↓
[NEW] ChangeEventConverter → Impingement
    ↓
CapabilityRegistry.broadcast() → RuleCapability.can_resolve()
    ↓
RuleCapability.activate() → produce() → Action
    ↓
PhasedExecutor (unchanged)
```

### Structural Mapping

| Current | Cascade | Similarity |
|---------|---------|------------|
| ChangeEvent | Impingement | 85% — add strength, type |
| trigger_filter → bool | can_resolve → float | 90% — bool becomes score |
| produce → list[Action] | activate → result | 70% — same logic |
| Phase 0/1/2 | activation_cost 0.0/0.5/1.0 | 95% — direct mapping |
| Cooldown | Inhibition of return | 85% — same mechanism |

### What Stays As-Is
- All 13 existing rules (trigger_filter, produce functions)
- PhasedExecutor (semaphore-bounded concurrency)
- Filesystem watcher (inotify/watchdog)
- Audit log + history ring buffer
- Novelty detection + pattern counters

### Files Changed
- `logos/engine/converter.py` — NEW: ChangeEvent→Impingement (~100 lines)
- `logos/engine/rule_capability.py` — NEW: Rule→Capability wrapper (~80 lines)
- `logos/engine/__init__.py` — integrate converter + broadcast (~50 lines modified)
- Tests — converter + registry roundtrip (~200 lines)

### Code Volume
~450 lines new, ~70 lines modified, 0 lines deleted.

## Design Space 4: Sensor Backend Protocol

### Problem
14 timer-driven sync agents poll on fixed schedules. They produce data but don't emit impingements. The DMN can't consume their output without filesystem polling.

### Decision
**Sensors stay as sensors** — they are data producers, not capability consumers. They adopt a hybrid SensorBackend protocol parallel to PerceptionBackend.

### Protocol

```python
class SensorBackend(Protocol):
    name: str
    affordance_signature: frozenset[str]
    dimension_keys: dict[str, str]  # affordance → profile dimension
    tier: SensorTier  # FAST | MODERATE | SLOW | EVENT
    shm_write_path: Path | None

    def poll(self) -> dict[str, Any] | None  # None = no change
    def drain_impingements(self) -> list[Impingement]  # change notifications
```

### Key Design Decision
Sensors emit **low-strength impingements** (strength=0.3) on data change. These notify downstream agents (profiler, briefing, nudge engine) that profile data refreshed, without flooding the cascade with high-priority signals.

### /dev/shm Layout
```
/dev/shm/hapax-sensors/
├── gmail.json
├── gcalendar.json
├── chrome.json
└── ... (per-agent state snapshot)
```

### Migration Priority

| Tier | Agents | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 (highest impact) | stimmung_sync, gcalendar_sync, chrome_sync | ~7h |
| 2 (medium) | gmail_sync, gdrive_sync, watch_receiver | ~7h |
| 3 (defer) | git, youtube, obsidian, langfuse, claude_code, weather | ~14h |

### Manifest Extension
Add `sensor_metadata` field to AgentManifest YAML with affordance_signature, dimension_keys, tier, shm_write_path, activation_cost.

## Design Space 5: Anti-Correlation & Resource Arbitration

### Problem
`set_tpn_active()` exists in DMN but is never called. GPU contention theoretically possible between DMN, voice, and vision.

### Finding
**Anti-correlation is not currently needed for resource safety.** RTX 3090 has 16GB free with all models resident (DMN 3.3GB + Whisper 2.4GB + Kokoro 1GB + vision 2.5GB + embedding 1GB + compositor 2GB = 12.2GB of 24GB = 51% utilization). Existing VRAM watchdog handles overflow at 85%+.

### Minimal Implementation (architecturally valuable, not resource-critical)

**Voice → DMN signal via /dev/shm flag file:**
```python
# Voice daemon: when conversation starts
Path("/dev/shm/hapax-dmn/tpn_active").write_text("1")
# When conversation ends
Path("/dev/shm/hapax-dmn/tpn_active").write_text("0")

# DMN daemon: check each tick
tpn_flag = Path("/dev/shm/hapax-dmn/tpn_active")
active = tpn_flag.exists() and tpn_flag.read_text().strip() == "1"
self._pulse.set_tpn_active(active)
```

**Effect:** DMN slows from 5s→10s sensory, 30s→60s evaluative during voice conversation. Reduces Ollama inference frequency by 50%.

### Files Changed
- `agents/hapax_voice/__main__.py` — write flag on conversation start/end (~10 lines)
- `agents/dmn/__main__.py` — read flag each tick (~5 lines)

### GPU Semaphore Extension (deferred)
Extend GPU semaphore to guard all GPU operations only when VRAM watchdog hits 85%+ in production. Currently unnecessary — 16GB headroom is sufficient.
