"""ConsentLabel: DLM join-semilattice for information flow control.

A ConsentLabel is an immutable set of policies (owner, readers) that
tracks who may read data. Labels combine via join (union) — combining
data with different consent requirements produces the most restrictive
combination.

Algebraic structure: join-semilattice with bottom.
