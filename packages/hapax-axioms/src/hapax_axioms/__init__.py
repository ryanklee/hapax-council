"""hapax-axioms — single-operator axiom enforcement library.

Public API for downstream projects:

>>> from hapax_axioms import (
...     load_axioms,
...     load_patterns,
...     scan_text,
...     scan_commit_message,
...     scan_file,
... )

The library bundles a frozen snapshot of the five constitution-published
axioms (single_user, executive_function, management_governance,
interpersonal_transparency, corporate_boundary) and the T0 violation
patterns extracted from the council repo's pre-commit gate. The original
spec at https://github.com/ryanklee/hapax-constitution remains the
canonical, evolving source of truth.
