"""Active correction seeking — system asks for corrections when uncertain.

WS3 Level 4: instead of waiting for the operator to notice errors, the
system proactively surfaces low-confidence interpretations as ambient
questions. Minimally intrusive: appears in the visual layer's ambient
text, not as an interruption.

Constraints:
  - Exploration budget: max queries per day (default 5)
  - Diminishing: don't re-ask about the same dimension+value combo
  - Cooldown: minimum time between queries (default 10 min)
  - Only asks when confidence is below threshold

Uses:
  - Stimmung perception_confidence for uncertainty detection
  - Correction memory similarity for "have we asked about this before?"
  - Visual layer ambient text channel for non-intrusive surfacing
