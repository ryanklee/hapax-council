"""Evil Pet preset pack — CC-burst fallback, `.evl` file-free (#194).

Phase 1 of ``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-evil-pet-preset-pack-
plan.md``. Ships the CC-burst fallback path per plan §Phase 4:

> "Depending on Phase 5 result, implement as PC message OR as direct
> CC 16-burst of the preset's parameter values, bypassing preset-
> recall entirely."

The `.evl` SD-card preset format reverse is deferred pending operator
providing a factory file. This module gives operators a working
recall pattern today: named presets → CC bursts → direct MIDI emit.

Scope:

- ``EvilPetPreset`` dataclass — name, description, CC map
  (cc_number → value) in 0..127.
- ``PRESETS`` module-level registry with one preset per VoiceTier +
  Mode D + bypass + 4 routing-aware presets (Phase 2 extension:
  hapax-sampler-wet, hapax-bed-music, hapax-drone-loop,
  hapax-s4-companion) — 13 entries total.
- ``recall_preset(preset_name, midi_output, channel)`` helper —
  emits the CC burst synchronously; tolerates MIDI-down.
- Each preset builds on the shared base-scene CCs from the
  voice-tier Catalog where applicable; tier 5/6 presets add the
  granular engine engagement CCs verbatim from
  ``shared.voice_tier.TIER_CATALOG``.
- ``list_presets()`` / ``get_preset(name)`` — read-only lookups.
