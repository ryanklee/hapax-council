"""Vinyl playback rate signal reader.

The operator plays records on a Korg Handytrax-PLAY. The deck's RPM
selector is discrete — playing a 45 RPM record on the 33⅓ setting
produces a non-standard playback rate of 0.741× (not the literal 0.5×
that the pre-2026-04-18 code assumed). A live-tuned pitch knob adds
±10% around the selected preset.

**Authority:** ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/vinyl-playback-rate.txt``
contains a single float. ``1.0`` = no rate distortion (standard
playback). ``< 1.0`` = slowed playback. Values outside ``[0.25, 2.0]``
are clamped to defend downstream ffmpeg filters.

**Legacy shim:** the pre-2026-04-18 flag
``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/vinyl-mode.txt`` carried a boolean "true"
/ "false". On read, "true" maps to ``0.741`` (45-on-33 preset),
"false" maps to ``1.0``. The boolean file is deprecated; new writers
should prefer the float file. Both readers live here so there is one
source of truth for rate-aware consumers (album-identifier, BPM
tracker, reactivity compensation).

Operator invariant (CVS #3 / 2026-04-18): scripts that assumed a
hardcoded 2× speedup (e.g. ``scripts/album-identifier.py`` using
``asetrate=88200,aresample=44100``) must be ported to
``rate_to_restore_factor()`` so the restoration is correct for any
playback preset.
