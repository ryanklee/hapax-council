"""Ward ↔ FX bidirectional event bus.

HOMAGE Phase 6 Layer 5 — the operator-directive "wards are supposed to be
highly dynamically integrated with the composite layer: engaging in
rotation, cycling, etc whose motions and dynamism is supported by
composite effect layers or usage" (2026-04-19).

Two event types flow through a single thread-safe pubsub bus:

* :class:`WardEvent` — published when a ward FSM transitions (entering,
  emphasized, exiting, etc.). Consumed by the FX chain reactor to
  modulate shader params / preset-family bias.
* :class:`FXEvent` — published when the FX chain fires a significant
  event (preset family change, audio kick onset, chain swap, intensity
  spike). Consumed by Cairo ward sources + the rendering layer to
  trigger accent-pulses / scale bumps / brightness spikes.

The bus is a process-local in-memory pubsub with a ring buffer of the
last 100 events mirrored to
``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/ward-fx-events.jsonl`` for cross-agent
observability (daimonion reads this to align voice register; Grafana /
debugging can tail it).

Thread-safety: the compositor is multi-threaded (GStreamer streaming
threads, Cairo render threads, GLib main loop, prometheus poll thread).
Publish / subscribe / ring-buffer reads are guarded by a single
``threading.Lock`` — event volume is low (~ones per second, not
thousands), so lock contention is not a performance concern. Subscribers
are invoked *outside* the lock so a slow subscriber never starves the
producer.

Why two event types on one bus: the coupling is bidirectional, and both
sides want to see both flows in the observability stream (e.g. an
``audio_kick_onset`` immediately followed by an ``ENTERING`` ward event
is a visible causal chain worth reading back in a single jsonl tail).
Separate ``WardEvent`` / ``FXEvent`` classes keep the types honest.
