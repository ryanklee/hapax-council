"""Gate-event log — the measurement spine for capability-aware routing.

Appends one JSON line per routing-gate decision to a PERSISTENT path
(``~/.cache/hapax/sdlc-routing/gate-events.jsonl`` — NOT tmpfs, so it survives a
reboot). This is the substrate the cost-offload program lacked: it derives the
dev-story A/B harness, the shadow->promote counter, and the capability-coverage
scorecard. Additive and standalone — importing it has no side effects and no
caller is required to use it yet (Phase 0.2; callers wire in Phase 2+).

Design: ``~/projects/cost-offload-program/CAPABILITY-ROUTING-DESIGN-2026-06-16.md`` §4.
Capability-routing Tier-1 (ISAP ``S5-CAPABILITY-ROUTING-TIER1``).

    A ``DEFAULT_GATE_LOG`` that DIFFERS IN VALUE from the import-time one wins, then
    ``HAPAX_GATE_LOG``, then the current home. Resolving at call time is what keeps a
    test process that changed its environment after import from appending to the
    operator's routing ledger.

    **The value comparison is deliberate, and the first line used to overstate it**
    as "a patched ``DEFAULT_GATE_LOG`` wins" (review finding, claude, at `069e726dc`).
    A patch to a path EQUAL to the import-time value does NOT win, and must not: a
    value indistinguishable from the one this module bound at import is
    indistinguishable from nobody having set it, and treating it as an override is
    exactly how the stale import-time default reached the operator's routing ledger
    in the first place. `test_import_time_default_gate_log_does_not_override_the_
    environment` pins that case directly.

    So this is a real limit, not a latent bug: an override that happens to equal the
    import-time path cannot be honoured, because it cannot be recognised. Switching
    to ``is not`` would recognise it — and would reopen the leak for every caller
    holding the import-time value, which is the condition the seam exists to catch.
    Measured before choosing: that change turns the pin above red.
