"""Vinyl broadcast signal-chain verifier — software-side wiring (#195).

Alpha handoff Tier 4 #16. The vinyl broadcast chain's hardware topology
(Handytraxx → Evil Pet + Torso S-4 → L6 → PipeWire → RTMP) is operator-
owned per
``docs/research/2026-04-20-vinyl-broadcast-signal-chain-topology.md``.
This module ships the software-side wiring: a verifier that asserts the
expected PipeWire nodes + channel routes are present in the live graph,
and reports specific deviations in human-readable form.

Composes with ``shared.audio_topology_inspector.pw_dump_to_descriptor``
(Phase 4 of the audio-topology CLI) so the same pw-dump JSON can drive
both the general verify and the vinyl-specific one.

Scope:

- Check that the L6 multitrack source is enumerated.
- Check that the Handytraxx source (or equivalent line-in stereo pair)
  is present when ``mode_d_active`` flag is set.
- Check that the broadcast tap (``hapax-livestream-tap`` or current
  collapsed target) exists downstream of the L6 master.
- Check that Evil Pet + Torso S-4 USB nodes are active when their
  respective capability daemons are running.
- Emit one ``VinylChainFinding`` per deviation so the operator sees
  an ordered diff.

What this module does NOT do:
- No MIDI (evil_pet_state.py owns that).
- No CC emission.
- No live-graph mutation — verification only. The operator applies
  remediation via the L6 retargets runbook
  (``docs/superpowers/handoff/2026-04-20-delta-l6-retargets-
  operator-runbook.md``).
