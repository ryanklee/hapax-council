"""Impingement — a detected deviation from the DMN's predictive model.

The universal currency of the activation cascade. Every impingement
represents something the DMN couldn't resolve internally and needs
to broadcast for capability recruitment.

Impingements are:
- Immutable (frozen Pydantic models)
- Traceable (id + parent_id for cascade chains)
- Typed (statistical deviation, pattern match, salience integration, absolute threshold)
- Scored (strength determines activation level of recruited capabilities)
