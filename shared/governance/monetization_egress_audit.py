"""Monetization egress audit writer — demonet Phase 6.

Every ``RiskAssessment`` emitted by ``MonetizationRiskGate`` lands in
a JSONL trail so post-stream analysis can answer:

- Which capabilities were blocked? By which reason class?
- Which Programme opt-ins were actually exercised vs declared but
  never hit?
- How often did a high-risk capability even _attempt_ recruitment
  (governance stress-test)?

Storage: ``~/hapax-state/demonet-egress-audit.jsonl`` (configurable
per-writer). Appended-to line-by-line; rotation helper cuts the file
into dated archives so a Grafana dashboard can tail the live file
without re-reading 30 days of history.

Scope (Phase 6):

- Append-only writer with thread-safe open+write.
- Rotation helper — splits the live file into
  ``demonet-egress-audit.YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`` archives.
- 30-day retention pruner.
- No Grafana dashboard, no systemd timer (operator ships those).
- No JSON schema validation — the record shape is Pydantic's
  ``RiskAssessment.model_dump_json()`` + timestamp + capability name.
  Downstream consumers parse with their own Pydantic reader.
