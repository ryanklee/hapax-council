"""Quiet-frame programme — zero-opt-in Programme for safety holds.

Phase 11 of ``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-demonetization-safety-
plan.md``. A prebuilt ``Programme`` the operator (or governance
automation) activates to gate ALL medium-risk capabilities and bias
toward minimum-risk tier bands during sensitive moments:

- Pre-monetization windows (first ~30 s of each stream start — the
  YouTube ContentID classifier is running its first-pass fingerprint
  scan; any brand-name in a title or audible music snippet risks an
  immediate claim)
- Sensitive discussions (operator is talking about something that
  shouldn't surface any external content)
- Cooldown after a ContentID hit (15-min minimum pause on anything
  medium-or-above)

The programme is ``ProgrammeRole.AMBIENT`` with empty
``monetization_opt_ins`` and ``voice_tier_band_prior=(0, 2)`` so the
MonetizationRiskGate blocks everything above ``low``-risk on any
surface and the voice-tier resolver picks a band that stays
intelligible (0-2 = UNADORNED through BROADCAST_GHOST).

Activation model:

- ``operator`` invokes via the CLI or a slash command
- ``governance`` automation activates on ContentID hit detection
  (wiring lands with Phase 3 Ring 2 classifier — task #202)
- Either path writes the programme to the ProgrammePlanStore via
  ``activate(programme_id, now)`` which enforces the one-ACTIVE
  invariant — the quiet frame deactivates any prior Programme
  automatically.
