"""Guest detection and consent facilitation trigger.

When the system detects a non-operator person (face_count > 1, speaker
not identified as operator), this module:

1. Emits a guest_detected event
2. Checks for existing consent contracts
3. If no contract: builds the channel menu and sends notification
4. If contract exists: allows data flow normally

This is the bridge between the perception layer (detection) and the
governance layer (consent). It does NOT decide what to do with data —
that's ConsentGatedWriter's job. It only ensures consent is offered.
