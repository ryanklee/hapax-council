"""Music policy — what to do when third-party music is detected on-stream.

Phase 8 of ``docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-demonetization-safety-plan.md``.
Two paths documented in §11 Q1 of the plan:

- **Path A (mute-and-transcript)** — detected music triggers a mute of
  the broadcast sink + a transcript burn-in of the most recent
  operator utterance (via the existing chronicle). Preserves narrative
  continuity for viewers. Chosen as delta's default per the
  ``unblock yourself, make the calls`` operator directive.
- **Path B (≤30s clip windower)** — detected music is allowed to play
  for a bounded window (30 s default), then muted until the operator
  explicitly re-authorises. Relies on fair-use interpretation which
  YouTube's ContentID does not honour algorithmically.

Chosen path: **A**. Rationale:

1. Silence cannot fingerprint-match.
2. Aligns with the "LLMs prepare, humans deliver" axiom — operator
   retains override via ``hapax-music-policy``.
3. Transcript preserves continuity.
4. Path B depends on fair-use heuristics ContentID ignores.

This module ships the policy surface. The detection path is a
``MusicDetector`` Protocol — a concrete implementation lands with
Phase 3 Ring 2 pre-render classifier (task #202). Until then, the
default ``NullMusicDetector`` returns "no music detected" so the
policy is an identity pass-through in production.
