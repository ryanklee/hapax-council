Extracts what model(s) actually ran in a Claude Code session from its transcript, plus
any silent ``model_refusal_fallback`` remaps (e.g. claude-fable-5 -> claude-opus-4-8).
This is the OBSERVED half of ``observed ⊆ sanctioned`` — consumed by the close-gate and

The client transcript is not provider-side truth (``endpoint_attested`` is False here);
a provider gateway / usage API is the authenticated source. But the transcript is where
