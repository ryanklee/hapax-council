"""Director intent schema — what the studio-compositor director emits per tick.

The director's role is the livestream's meta-structure communication device
(memory `feedback_director_grounding.md`). Its output is structured intent,
not capability invocations: a declared activity + stance + narrative utterance
+ compositional impingements + per-tick structural intent. The impingements
go through AffordancePipeline; capabilities recruit from there. The structural
intent drives the ward-property surface directly (rotation mode, per-ward
emphasis / dispatch / retire / placement-bias) so the director visibly shapes
the livestream surface every tick without waiting for the slow (90s) structural
tier. This keeps unified-semantic-recruitment intact (no bypass paths — spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-02-unified-semantic-recruitment-design.md`).

Epic: volitional grounded director (PR #1017, spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-volitional-grounded-director-design.md`).
Homage-surface activation (2026-04-18, cascade-delta): `NarrativeStructuralIntent`
lets the fast narrative tier drive ward-level rotation / emphasis / dispatch /
placement every tick so the homage surface becomes aesthetically active —
spec §4.13 + operator directive "unavoidable evidence of active thoughtful
manipulation".
