"""Persona-prompt composer — loads the compressed description-of-being.

LRR Phase 7 §4.4 integration prep. Returns the LLM-fragment form of the
persona document for consumption by voice prompts, director-loop prompts,
or any other LLM system-prompt assembler.

Design contract:

- This module is a loader + role-declaration appender. It does NOT
  synthesize or re-phrase the persona document. The document at
  ``axioms/persona/hapax-description-of-being.prompt.md`` IS the
  authoritative fragment; this module just reads and optionally
  suffixes a current-role line.
- The fragment is produced in description-of-being form, not
  personification form. Every claim traces to real architecture per
  the full document at ``axioms/persona/hapax-description-of-being.md``.
- Role_id adaptation is a one-line suffix ("Current role instance: X"),
  not a content filter. The full description-of-being is always
  present; the role declaration lets the LLM know which thick position
  is currently active. Role selection is a lens, not a persona variant.

Callers (future PRs):

- ``agents/hapax_daimonion/persona.py::system_prompt()`` — voice daemon
  system prompt assembly (gated by ``HAPAX_PERSONA_DOCUMENT_DRIVEN``).
- ``agents/studio_compositor/director_loop.py::_build_unified_prompt``
  — director-loop unified prompt (add persona section).

The feature-flag pattern keeps the rollout safe: voice daemon and
director loop keep current behavior until the flag is flipped.
