"""Evil Pet granular-engine ownership flag — single-writer arbitration.

Implements §2, §3, §6, §8 of docs/research/2026-04-20-mode-d-voice-tier-
mutex.md. Mode D (vinyl anti-DMCA granular wash) and voice tiers 5/6
(voice granular wash / obliterated) both configure the same Evil Pet
granular engine over MIDI channel 0. Last-write-wins on CCs produces
state-space thrash; simultaneous engagement also sums two uncorrelated
sources into the engine's L-in and destroys both regimes. This module
provides the authoritative single-owner flag.

Scope:

- **Arbitrate** — which writer may claim the engine (pure function;
  priority classes operator/governance > programme > director).
- **Persist** — authoritative state at
  ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/evil-pet-state.json`` via atomic
  tmp+rename. Readers never observe a partial write.
- **Fail-safe** — 15 s heartbeat staleness falls back to ``bypass``; the
  next reader sees the engine as free regardless of crashed writers.
- **Legacy compat** — maintains
  ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/mode-d-active`` flag exists/absent
  semantics while downstream consumers migrate.

Does NOT emit MIDI CCs. Ownership is orthogonal to the transition
sequence — the owning capability (``VinylChainCapability``,
``VocalChainCapability``) handles its own CC emission AFTER acquiring
ownership here. See §4 of the research doc for the handoff protocol.
