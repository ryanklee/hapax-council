"""Capability dispatch — the friendly one-command surface over the routing spine.

The capability-routing spine works (``evaluate_dispatch_policy`` routes correctly;
several routes are live). What was missing is (1) a human surface — you had to
hand-craft ``hapax-methodology-dispatch`` flags — and (2) the *observability view*:
which of the fleet's capabilities are actually USED vs sitting LATENT ("we are
slower and worse" for not using them).

This module supplies both, the right way *per the spine* — it does NOT write a
parallel ledger. ``hapax-methodology-dispatch`` already persists every dispatch to
``~/.cache/hapax/orchestration/methodology-dispatch.jsonl`` (``write_receipt``) and
emits gate-events. So here we add only the two genuinely-missing pieces:

1. The capability ALIAS layer (capability-difference axiom: each named capability /
   variant is a routable surface). Friendly name -> governed ``route_id``, validated
   against the registry's ``required_route_ids`` (the SSOT) so the table cannot drift.
2. The UTILIZATION view: roll the existing dispatch ledger into active-vs-latent —
   the "latent resource" metric made visible.

cost/quality population (per-route cost from LiteLLM ``_response_cost``, execution-
derived quality from the gate-event/floor-checker) is the measurement-completion
follow-on; this module exposes what the spine already records.
