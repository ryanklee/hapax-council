"""Torso S-4 scene library (Phase B4 of evilpet-s4-dynamic-dual-processor-plan).

10 scenes, each a 5-slot configuration (Material / Granular / Filter /
Color / Space) with per-slot CC overrides. Paired with Evil Pet presets
via ``shared.evil_pet_presets.DEFAULT_PAIRINGS``.

Scene recall mechanism: MIDI program change (primary, <= 50 ms) OR
per-slot CC bursts (fallback, <= 200 ms). Sent via
``shared.s4_midi.emit_program_change`` / ``emit_cc`` when the S-4 is
USB-connected.

The scene CC values here are delta's initial draft per spec §4.2.
Operator ratifies aesthetic tuning in PR review; the spec explicitly
treats CC values as operator-aesthetic-authority.
