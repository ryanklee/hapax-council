# The old standalone LLM-stack backup path has been retired. It overlapped with
# the service-native Tier 1/B2/GDrive-critical backup lanes and carried stale
# PostgreSQL assumptions. Keep this entry point side-effect-light so legacy timers or
# manual invocations cannot create misleading backup artifacts.
