# Delta 2026-04-14-systemd-timer-enablement-gap.md identified that 14 of 51
# council timers had been linked (symlinked into ~/.config/systemd/user/)
# but never enabled (no symlink in timers.target.wants/). The previous
# version of this script only enabled *newly* linked timers, so any timer
# that was linked in one run but failed to enable (or the operator ran
# SKIP_TIMER_ENABLE=1, or the script was killed mid-run) stayed dead
# forever.
#
# Fix: always sweep every repo-owned timer symlink and run
# ``systemctl --user enable`` on each. ``enable`` is idempotent for
# already-enabled units, so the cost of a re-sweep on a clean state is
# effectively zero — one subprocess per timer. We do NOT pass --now in
# the sweep: that is the right behavior for first install (the newly-
# linked path above), but in the sweep a timer that is merely linked-
# but-not-enabled has been dormant possibly for weeks, and firing it
# synchronously from the install script is surprising. ``enable`` alone
# creates the .wants symlink; the next daemon-reload and the timer will
# then fire on its natural schedule.

# LRR Phase 3 item 1: walk ``systemd/units/*.service.d/`` directories
# and install each drop-in as a real symlink under
# ``~/.config/systemd/user/<service>.service.d/<name>.conf``. Previously
# the script only handled top-level unit files, so drop-ins shipped in
# the repo (audio-recorder.service.d/, contact-mic-recorder.service.d/)
# were silently not installed. Phase 3 adds tabbyapi.service.d/ and
# hapax-dmn.service.d/ — both MUST be active for the Option α → γ
# partition reconciliation to take effect. Handling this class of
# file now fixes both the new drop-ins and the latent existing ones.
#
# Destination layout: ``~/.config/systemd/user/<service>.service.d/``
# is a REAL directory (not a symlink). Individual ``.conf`` files
# inside it are symlinks back to the repo. This matches the existing
# manually-placed ``tabbyapi.service.d/gpu-pin.conf`` file that has
# been on disk since Sprint 5b Phase 2a.
