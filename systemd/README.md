# systemd Service Management

Application and utility services run as systemd user units under `user@1000.service` with lingering enabled. Narrow host-safety units, including the root OOM enforcer and its failure-intake bridge, run in the system manager. No process supervisors (process-compose, supervisord) are in the boot chain.

**Topology:** <!-- topology-inventory:services -->301<!-- /topology-inventory:services --> services, <!-- topology-inventory:timers -->147<!-- /topology-inventory:timers --> timers, 6 paths, 3 targets. Verify with `uv run python scripts/hapax_topology_inventory.py --check`.

`scripts/hapax_topology_inventory.py` is source-only: it verifies the
git-tracked `systemd/units/` topology and does not prove what the live user
manager has loaded or enabled. For runtime reconciliation, use:

```bash
uv run python scripts/hapax-systemd-inventory-reconcile --summary
uv run python scripts/hapax-systemd-inventory-reconcile --json
```

The reconciler is read-only. It compares `git ls-files systemd/units` with
`systemctl --user list-unit-files --type=service,timer` and
`systemctl --user list-units --all --type=service,timer`, then reports matched,
tracked-only, and runtime-only units with the exact commands and timestamp.
Do not use source topology counts as claims about active runtime state.

## Architecture

Three tiers, two managers:

```
Docker Compose (infrastructure)     systemd user units (application + utilities)
─────────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
qdrant, postgres, redis,            hapax-secrets     → all credentials (oneshot)
litellm, langfuse, grafana,         logos-api         → FastAPI :8051
prometheus, clickhouse,             hapax-daimonion       → voice daemon (GPU)
n8n, open-webui, minio, ntfy       visual-layer-agg  → perception pipeline
                                    studio-compositor → camera tiling (GPU)
Managed by:                         studio-fx-output  → ffmpeg /dev/video50
  llm-stack.service (oneshot)       hapax-watch-recv  → Wear OS biometrics
  llm-stack-analytics.service       147 timers        → sync, health, backups
```

## Grouping Targets

Two top-level grouping targets organise the application stack:

- **`hapax-visual-stack.target`** — production visual surface pipeline: `hapax-imagination`, `hapax-imagination-loop`, `hapax-dmn`, `hapax-reverie`, `hapax-content-resolver`, `visual-layer-aggregator`, `studio-compositor`. Lists dependents explicitly via `Wants=`. The Tauri/WebKit `hapax-logos` preview is decommissioned and is not pulled in by this target.
- **`hapax.target`** — non-visual application services: broadcast/audio (`hapax-mastodon-post`, `hapax-bluesky-post`, `hapax-omg-lol-fanout`, `hapax-channel-trailer`), awareness (`hapax-operator-awareness`), marketing/observability (`hapax-chronicle-quality-exporter`, `hapax-impingement-sampler`, `hapax-quota-observability`, `hapax-youtube-telemetry`), mail-monitor (`hapax-mail-monitor-watch-renewal`, `hapax-mail-monitor-weekly-digest`), `hapax-broadcast-orchestrator`. Dependent units declare `WantedBy=hapax.target`; enabling each unit creates a symlink under `~/.config/systemd/user/hapax.target.wants/`, and starting the target pulls the whole stack. `hapax-live-cuepoints.service` is parked while its feature flag remains disabled, `hapax-feedback-loop-detector.service` is parked with the retired Behringer L-12 path, and `hapax-discord-webhook` was decommissioned 2026-05-01.

Both targets are `WantedBy=default.target` so they activate on user login.

## Boot Sequence

```
1. hapax-secrets.service     Load credentials from pass store → /run/user/1000/hapax-secrets.env
2. llm-stack.service         docker compose --profile full up -d (waits 30s for Docker daemon)
3. llm-stack-analytics       docker compose --profile analytics up -d (60s after llm-stack)
4. logos-api.service         After: llm-stack, hapax-secrets
5. officium-api.service      After: llm-stack, hapax-secrets
6. hapax-daimonion.service       After: pipewire, hapax-secrets (+10s delay for GPU sequencing)
7. hapax-imagination        After: hapax-secrets (GPU wgpu visual surface)
7a. hapax-reverie             After: hapax-secrets, hapax-dmn (visual expression daemon)
7b. hapax-content-resolver   After: logos-api (content resolution daemon)
7c. hapax-imagination-loop   After: hapax-secrets (imagination reverberation)
8. visual-layer-aggregator   After: logos-api, hapax-daimonion, hapax-secrets
9. studio-compositor         After: hapax-daimonion, visual-layer-aggregator (+10s for USB cameras)
10. studio-fx-output         After: studio-compositor
11. Timers activate          vram-watchdog (30s), health-monitor (15m), sync agents, backups,
                              rebuild-logos (5m), rebuild-services (5m)
```

## Secrets

Single centralized service (`hapax-secrets.service`) loads all credentials once at boot:

- `LITELLM_API_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` — API access
- `HF_TOKEN` — HuggingFace model downloads
- `LITELLM_BASE_URL`, `LANGFUSE_HOST` — service endpoints

Written to `/run/user/1000/hapax-secrets.env` (tmpfs, 0600). Credential-consuming application services declare `Requires=hapax-secrets.service` and read via `EnvironmentFile=/run/user/1000/hapax-secrets.env`; host-safety audits and recovery bridges intentionally do not load application credentials.

### Studio Mobile RTMP

`studio-compositor` supports a parallel 9:16 mobile RTMP egress. Runtime
mode defaults to `dual`; set `HAPAX_BROADCAST_MODE=desktop|mobile|dual` or
write `/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/broadcast-mode.json` through
`PATCH /api/studio/broadcast-mode`.

- `HAPAX_MOBILE_RTMP_URL` defaults to `rtmp://127.0.0.1:1935/mobile`.
- `HAPAX_MOBILE_RTMP_KEY` is optional and must come from `hapax-secrets` or
  another runtime-only secret source, never from repo config.

## Resource Isolation

**Per-service caps** (delegated user services retain the manager score):

| Service | MemoryMax | Configured OOMScoreAdjust | Required live oom_score_adj | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| hapax-daimonion | 16G | 100 | 100 | GPU STT models, grows under conversation load |
| studio-compositor | 6G | 100 | 100 | livestream critical |
| hapax-imagination | 4G | 100 | 100 | wgpu visual surface |
| hapax-rebuild-logos | 12G | default | unchanged | transient cargo+rustc wgpu build |
| hapax-rebuild-services | 6G | default | unchanged | transient python rebuild cascade |
| album-identifier | 4G | default | unchanged | IR vision + audio track recognition |
| youtube-player | 2G | default | unchanged | ffmpeg children |
| chat-monitor | 2G | default | unchanged | YouTube Live chat analysis |
| logos-api | 8G | default | unchanged | FastAPI :8051 |
| visual-layer-aggregator | 4G | default | unchanged | perception pipeline |
| hapax-reverie | 4G | default | unchanged | visual expression daemon |
| hapax-dmn | 4G | default | unchanged | cognitive substrate |
| officium-api | 512M | default | unchanged | FastAPI :8050 |
| hapax-content-resolver | 512M | default | unchanged | content resolver |
| hapax-watch-receiver | 256M | default | unchanged | Wear OS biometrics |
| hapax-recent-impingements | 128M | default | unchanged | salience overlay producer |
| stimmung-sync | 2G | default | unchanged | MemoryHigh=1G; role-specific source ceiling after 2026-05-13 `CONSTRAINT_MEMCG` evidence |

Recheck these four corrected hard limits with `systemctl --user show logos-api.service visual-layer-aggregator.service hapax-reverie.service hapax-dmn.service -p Id -p MemoryMax` and compare them with the corresponding tracked units under `systemd/units/`.

**System-wide memory infrastructure:**

- **128GB host memory policy**: the retired 62G RAM / 63G swap inventory is
  not current source truth for this host. Runtime zram/swap sizing must be
  verified from a read-only host receipt before any zram-generator or swapfile
  change; source policy currently treats zram saturation, global RAM pressure,
  and service-local cgroup OOMs as separate incident classes.
- **Kernel reclaim tuning** (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-hapax-memory.conf`):
  - `vm.min_free_kbytes=524288` — 512MB allocation buffer (raised from default 66MB) to prevent cascade OOM under transient spikes
  - `vm.watermark_scale_factor=100` — kswapd reclaims at 1% pressure (default 10 is too late under zram+heavy-IO)
  - `vm.swappiness=5` — tuned for 128GB RAM with audio/livestream workload (low swap preference)
- **`stimmung-sync.service` ceiling rationale**: the 2026-05-13 incident was
  service-local cgroup pressure, not global RAM exhaustion: `stimmung-sync` was
  killed under `CONSTRAINT_MEMCG` at the old 128M hard ceiling while the host
  still had tens of GiB available. A runtime mitigation completed at 56.9M
  peak with a 512M hard ceiling; source now keeps this periodic RAG/state sync
  job at `MemoryHigh=1G` and `MemoryMax=2G` to absorb Python import,
  embedding, and persistence bursts while remaining bounded. This is not a
  blanket limit increase for 128M utility timers.
- **earlyoom** (`/etc/default/earlyoom`, source: `config/earlyoom/default`): fires SIGTERM @ 5% avail / 5% swap-free, SIGKILL @ 2.5%.
  - `--prefer`: `cargo|rustc|ld.lld|chrome|electron|node|claude|next-server|ffmpeg|bwrap` (expendable targets for OOM)
  - `--avoid`: `Hyprland|pipewire|wireplumber|dockerd|containerd|bluetoothd|systemd|foot|waybar|hapax-imaginati` (best-effort process-comm matching; `hapax-imaginati` is the live-observed `/proc/<pid>/comm` 15-byte truncation. Python-hosted daimonion and currently inactive services are not represented by speculative unit-name tokens; the explicitly enumerated protected units below receive separate cgroup memory reservations.)
  - `--ignore`: `apcupsd|systemd-logind|systemd-resolve|systemd-timesyn|systemd-userdbd|dbus-broker|dbus-daemon|NetworkManager|sshd|sshd-session|getty|agetty` (operator recovery and UPS telemetry must not be earlyoom victims; long names use `/proc/<pid>/comm` 15-byte truncation)
- **P0 OOM policy source package** (`scripts/install-p0-oom-containment`): validates the versioned per-host policy data and ownership manifest only. It performs no account lookup, live readback, root delegation, file installation, service activation, Docker mutation, or receipt advancement. A successful source check is not runtime or task-closure evidence.
  - Canonical host admission is exact and fail-closed: `hapax-appendix` accepts inclusive integer-`MemTotal` floors `59..61` GiB and selects `MemoryHigh=46G` / `MemoryMax=54G` for `app.slice`, `48G` / `56G` for the UID tree, and 16 GiB zram. `hapax-podium` accepts `123..125` GiB and selects `72G` / `88G`, `80G` / `96G`, and 32 GiB zram. Unknown hosts, overlap, out-of-interval memory, ceilings at or above the interval floor, zram below 8 GiB, or zram above half the interval floor fail source validation and recurring observation.
  - The profile tree is symmetric under `config/root-required/oom-host-policy/{appendix,podium}/`. Table values and every selected systemd/zram artifact must agree exactly; extra profile files, symlinks, duplicate hosts/profiles, and manifest omissions fail validation.
  - Production `--install`, `--verify-live`, and the retired authenticated sealed-source mode return rc `77` as the first executable branch, before source resolution, NSS, lock, tool, or filesystem lookup. Test selectors cannot reopen a mutation path.
  - Post-merge deployment may stage the exact changed OOM package and desired SHA as **non-authoritative desired-state evidence**. Its OOM `RUNBOOK.txt` contains no executable install command. Staging does not stop, replace, or reconcile an already installed auditor, enforcer, trigger, timer, or sudoers grant; those bytes may retain historical mutating behavior until a separately authorized cutover. Same-UID staged files and receipts are inputs to future work, never proof of runtime authority or completion, and the OOM group is excluded from postmerge runtime-witness claims.
  - `hapax-oom-policy-audit` is observational. JSON declares `authoritative=false` and `scope=observational-live-drift`; it never starts the enforcer or mutates systemd/Docker. The canonical installed path rejects every test selector. It checks the selected host interval, exact zram size/compression/activation, resolves the reviewed GitHub MCP RepoDigest to its separate local config ID, and requires every present `hapax-github-mcp-*` container to use that ID with 512 MiB RAM / 768 MiB RAM+swap and the OOM killer enabled. The launcher uses a private random name and launch label so cleanup can discover a missing-cidfile container, validate its immutable signature, and remove only its full ID. The audit also checks absence of the retired local judge and the existing memory/OOM invariants. Appendix alone treats the absent daimonion, compositor, and imagination user units as optional.
  - `hapax-root-required-deploy-audit` binds its installed-source snapshot to every manifest-owned host-policy input and compares the installed profile table, but its clean result is also labeled non-authoritative. Same-UID desired/installed receipts plus matching drift observations do not attest broker execution or task closure.
  - Root-negative scoring of delegated user services is retired. The packaged enforcer and trigger are non-mutating compatibility sentinels, user-unit drop-ins have no startup trigger, the sudoers package delegates no enforcer command, and the timer has no install target. The observational audit requires the timer and service to be inactive, every protected user process to remain at `100`, and reports any observed negative UID-1000 score as historical drift. This is intentionally a point-in-time observation, not proof that no process forked or moved between reads.
  - A separately authorized runtime cutover must run from a root-owned control channel independent of the Hapax user manager; stop and disable the historical timer before replacing the enforcer, trigger, and sudoers bytes; reload the system manager; temporarily apply a root-owned mask to `user@1000.service` so linger and on-demand activation cannot repopulate it; and stop the complete delegated `user@1000.service` subtree to a root-observed empty-cgroup quiescence boundary before unmasking and restarting it. This deliberately takes down the user manager and all services beneath it during cutover. It does not sweep a future root-owned, non-delegated system unit merely because that unit runs with `User=hapax`. A post-cutover start time alone is insufficient because a new child can inherit from an old parent before that parent exits. Source conformance and a point-in-time score scan do not perform or prove that cutover. If a workload truly requires a negative score, move it to such a root-owned system unit and let PID 1 apply `OOMScoreAdjust` directly. Do not reintroduce a sudo bridge into `user@1000.service`.
  - `hapax-local-judge.service` is absent from the source unit directory. Post-merge classification treats that exact historical path before old or current package manifests and records runtime deferral, so a cumulative diff cannot hand it to generic user, system, or OOM deployment. The generic user-unit installer owns its retry-convergent retirement transaction and leaves an installed `/dev/null` mask: it captures a full immutable container ID, disables and masks the historical unit before stopping its workload, removes wants/drop-ins, reconciles only that ID, and rejects a replacement identity. A retry starting from an existing mask still completes pending Docker cleanup. This source task does not authorize running the transaction on Appendix.
  - Future production application requires a separately reviewed root broker with a host-root-held trust anchor and signed request/result records binding request ID, exact package SHA, generation, effects, unit bytes, image/model digests, and completion. The mandatory threat input is `docs/security/root-authority-hazard-register.md`.
  - Source recheck: `scripts/install-p0-oom-containment --check --no-runtime` and `uv run pytest -q tests/scripts/test_p0_oom_containment_installer.py tests/scripts/test_hapax_oom_policy_audit.py tests/scripts/test_hapax_oom_score_enforce.py tests/test_install_units_sweep_pin.py`. Read-only live observation: `/usr/local/sbin/hapax-oom-policy-audit --json`; its pass result remains non-authoritative.
- **Other OOM overrides**: root-owned recovery daemons retain PID-1-managed negative scores; container and hardware-specific policy remains documented beside its installer. Every delegated user-unit source rejects negative scores; protected services remain at `100`.
- **UPS power-alert provenance** (`scripts/install-apcupsd-power-alerts`): defines and source-checks the apcupsd config/hooks/helper intended for `/etc/apcupsd`, hard-codes production hooks to `/etc/apcupsd/hapax-power-event.py`, and owns the intended logrotate and service policy. Post-merge stages this package and desired SHA as non-authoritative evidence; production `--install` is unavailable until a separately reviewed root broker can bind immutable package bytes through live mutation and authoritative completion. Live `--verify-live` remains read-only and requires both enabled and active service state. The logrotate stanza uses `su root root` because `/var/log/hapax` is group-writable for local audit writers, atomically renames and recreates the live file as `0640 root:hapax`, and delays compression for one rotation so a helper that opened the old inode before rename can finish appending to the retained `.1` file without losing the receipt. A concurrent real-logrotate regression holds such an in-flight writer across rotation and requires the complete pre-rotation and post-rotation event partition. Battery-transfer receipts say only that the transfer event itself does not request shutdown (`event_requests_shutdown=false`), while global `shutdown_requested` remains unknown; restoration receipts are also neutral because either event can follow a real `doshutdown`. All three hooks fail open so telemetry failure cannot suppress or indefinitely delay apccontrol: `onbattery` and `offbattery` have a hard ten-second whole-helper deadline, while the dedicated `doshutdown` hook has a hard five-second deadline and attempts to record both shutdown fields as true. A blocked helper may therefore complete without a receipt. On the shutdown path, apcaccess and ntfy also have one-second internal ceilings.
  - The installer safely opens or initializes the JSONL target as a single-link `0640 root:hapax` regular file and refuses symlinked, multiply-linked, or non-regular inodes before ownership/mode repair. Install verification and the recurring root audit enforce that runtime-artifact contract. The root-run helper independently opens the target with `O_NOFOLLOW`, locks and writes through the opened descriptor, and requires a single-link regular inode owned by the hook UID. A group member can therefore rotate/unlink the directory entry but cannot redirect a privileged hook append through a symlink or hard link; an unsafe inode degrades provenance and leaves apccontrol fail-open while the audits turn red.
  - `apcupsd` is the sole UPS shutdown-policy owner. `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf.d/90-hapax-apcupsd-owner.conf` keeps UPower available for status/history while pinning its critical action to `Ignore`. The future broker must restart apcupsd or reload UPower only when that daemon's owned files differ or its loaded-policy readback disagrees with source; matching and logrotate-only retries must not interrupt either daemon. Read-only verification and the recurring root audit require UPower's D-Bus `GetCriticalAction` value to be `Ignore` and compare apcupsd's loaded `MBATTCHG`, `MINTIMEL`, and `MAXTIME` values against source `BATTERYLEVEL`, `MINUTES`, and `TIMEOUT`. apcupsd retains the configured 20% charge / 5-minute runtime shutdown thresholds.
  - Recheck: `scripts/install-apcupsd-power-alerts --check` and `scripts/install-apcupsd-power-alerts --verify-live`. Repair requires preserving the exact desired package and dispatching separately runtime-authorized root-broker work; same-UID receipts, staged interpreters, and the isolated-test install path are not live authority.

**Runtime application / receipt path:** source changes in this directory are
not host mutation authority. A runtime-authorized follow-on task must first
record a read-only receipt:

- `free -h`
- `zramctl --raw --output NAME,DISKSIZE,DATA,COMPR,ALGORITHM,PRIO`
- `cat /proc/swaps`
- `cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`
- `systemctl --user show stimmung-sync.service -p MemoryHigh -p MemoryMax -p MemoryPeak -p NRestarts -p ActiveState -p Result --no-pager`

Only that separate runtime path may perform sysctl writes, zram-generator
changes, daemon reloads, unit installation, or service restarts.

**Design principle**: prevent global OOM by bounding transient memory spikers (cargo builds, ffmpeg), reserving memory for critical cgroups, and giving kernel reclaim a larger buffer. Protected user services keep the valid manager-inherited `OOMScoreAdjust=100`; `MemoryLow`/`MemoryMin` and slice ceilings provide their protection without conferring an inheritable root-only process attribute inside a delegated cgroup. Individual `session-N.scope` leaves may have no local limit, but they remain killable and are covered by the aggregate `user-1000.slice` hard ceiling.

## Ollama GPU Assignment

**Dual-GPU policy (2026-04-17):** Ollama runs on GPU 1 (5060 Ti, 16 GB); TabbyAPI runs exclusively on GPU 0 (3090, 24 GB). This replaces the earlier CPU-only isolation after the secondary GPU came online and the volitional-director rebalance freed the 3090 residency for Command-R 35B.

**Enforcement**: `/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/z-gpu-5060ti.conf` sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1`, `OLLAMA_NUM_GPU=999`, `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`. The `z-` prefix guarantees it is loaded last alphabetically, overriding the older `vram-optimize.conf` CPU-only settings. TabbyAPI's `config.yml` pins `gpu_split=[16, 10]` — TabbyAPI uses 16 GB on GPU 0 and 10 GB on GPU 1; Ollama uses the remaining ~6 GB on GPU 1. The two do not collide on GPU 0.

**Historical context**: LiteLLM previously had fallback chains (`local-fast → qwen3:8b`) that loaded Ollama's qwen3:8b on GPU 0 when TabbyAPI was slow. This caused a death spiral on the single-GPU era (qwen3:8b GPU 5.5 GiB + TabbyAPI 13 GiB = OOM on 24 GiB card; CPU fallback ate 900% CPU). Fallback chains were removed from `~/llm-stack/litellm-config.yaml`. The 5060 Ti installation + `z-gpu-5060ti.conf` pinning (2026-04-17) now make a repeat impossible: any GPU-capable Ollama model lands on GPU 1, which cannot collide with TabbyAPI's GPU 0 residency.

**Current Ollama role**: still embedding-heavy. `nomic-embed-cpu` is the stable Hapax alias called directly by `shared/config.py:embed()`; after the 2026-05-12 Nomic repair it aliases `nomic-embed-text-v2-moe:latest` (`nomic-bert-moe`, 768-dimensional embeddings, 512-token context). The alias name is historical and does not prove CPU-only execution: the active service is pinned to GPU 1 by `z-gpu-5060ti.conf`, and Ollama scheduling may use that GPU when it loads model weights. `qwen3:8b` was deleted; `qwen3.5:27b` was deleted 2026-04-21 to eliminate the largest VRAM-splash risk. Steady-state Ollama VRAM footprint is expected to be CUDA driver context only when no model weights are loaded. On-demand inference can load onto GPU 1's remaining memory.

**Embed frequency optimization** (PR #617): Startup capability indexing batched from 142 individual Ollama calls to 1 `embed_batch()` call, with a disk-persisted cache (`~/.cache/hapax/embed-cache.json`) that eliminates re-embedding across restarts. Second-and-subsequent daimonion startups index 142 capabilities with zero Ollama calls. Steady-state impingement embeds deduplicated by rendered narrative text (~50% reduction). See `shared/embed_cache.py`, `shared/affordance_pipeline.py:index_capabilities_batch()`.

## Installation

```bash
# Install/symlink all user units and drop-ins from this directory (idempotent)
systemd/scripts/install-units.sh

# Or manually link a single unit
ln -sf "$PWD/systemd/units/my-service.service" ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Top-level user `.service`, `.timer`, `.target`, `.path`, and `.slice`
units are normally symlinked, so edits to `systemd/units/` take effect on
`daemon-reload` without re-running the install script. `install-units.sh`
also installs drop-ins under `.service.d`, `.timer.d`, `.slice.d`, and
`.scope.d`; ordinary drop-ins are symlinked, while P0 host-safety OOM
drop-ins and the two recurring P0 audit service/timer pairs are skipped because
they belong to the source-only OOM package. This revision has no production
path that copies or activates them; only a future separately authorized root
broker may do so. Other system-scoped units marked
`# Hapax-Install-Scope: system` require their dedicated installer or governed
root-required deployment path.

`install-units.sh` also removes and masks retired units listed in its
`DECOMMISSIONED_UNITS` array if stale copies are present under
`~/.config/systemd/user/`. Currently retired:

- `hapax-logos.service`, `hapax-build-reload.path`,
  `hapax-build-reload.service`, `logos-dev.service` — Tauri/WebKit
  runtime, replaced by `hapax-imagination`.
- `tabbyapi-hermes8b.service` — second-instance TabbyAPI for the
  Hermes 3 8B parallel pivot. Operator abandoned Hermes 2026-04-15
  (drop #62 §14, commit `2bc6aec17`); the unit was retained as
  audit-trail reference until 2026-04-30 and never deployed (weights
  and config file referenced by the unit do not exist on disk).
  Cleanup also removes the linked `tabbyapi-hermes8b.service.d/`
  drop-in directory.
- `hapax-discord-webhook.service` — cross-surface Discord webhook
  poster for the `discord-webhook` publication-bus surface. Retired
  2026-05-01 per cc-task `discord-public-event-activation-or-retire`
  to close the constitutional drift between the existing
  `leverage-REFUSED-discord-community` refusal-brief (ratified
  2026-04-26) and the still-deployed FULL_AUTO surface entry. The
  agent module at `agents/cross_surface/discord_webhook.py` is
  retained as legacy reference; the surface is now `REFUSED` tier in
  `agents/publication_bus/surface_registry.py` so the orchestrator
  cannot reach it at runtime. The unit had been linked but never
  active (operator never bootstrapped `HAPAX_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`).
- `hapax-environmental-emphasis.service`, `hapax-environmental-emphasis.timer`
    — continuous-loop emphasis timer driver and its companion timer.
    Unit files and the `scripts/environmental_emphasis_tick.py` script were
    removed from the repo; stale symlinks discovered 2026-05-14 pointing to
    the deleted paths.
- `hapax-visual-pool-snapshot-harvester.service`,
    `hapax-visual-pool-snapshot-harvester.timer` — visual pool snapshot
    harvester for compositor frame capture. Unit files and the
    `scripts/visual-pool-snapshot-harvester.py` script were removed from
    the repo; stale symlinks discovered 2026-05-14.

**Newly installed timers are auto-enabled.** As of the audit-followups-e1 PR, `install-units.sh` runs `systemctl --user enable --now <name>.timer` for every timer file it sees for the first time. Existing timers are left alone (re-running is idempotent). To suppress this for a one-off install, set `SKIP_TIMER_ENABLE=1` before running the script (intentionally not a flag — disabling auto-enable is the rare case).

`systemd/user-preset.d/hapax.preset` mirrors the timers that must be enabled by default when preset tooling is used. Timer units still belong in `systemd/units/`; root-level `systemd/*.timer` files are not install-visible and should be moved into `systemd/units/`.

## CC Task Automation

The cc-task automation timers run against the source-activation worktree, not
the operator's interactive checkout:

| Timer | Script | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `hapax-cc-hygiene.timer` | `scripts/cc-hygiene-sweeper.py` | Read-only cc-task vault diagnostics. |
| `hapax-cc-pr-autoqueue.timer` | `scripts/cc-pr-autoqueue.py --apply` | Governed PR auto-queue/auto-merge arming for task-linked PRs. |
| `hapax-cc-pr-merge-watcher.timer` | `scripts/cc-pr-merge-watcher.py` | Auto-close active cc-tasks after linked PRs merge. |
| `hapax-pr-review-dispatch.timer` | `scripts/cc-pr-review-dispatch.py --all --apply` | Review-team dossier refresh for open task-linked PRs. |

Recheck the review-dispatch timer claim with:
`systemctl --user list-timers --all hapax-pr-review-dispatch.timer` and
`systemctl --user status hapax-pr-review-dispatch.timer hapax-pr-review-dispatch.service --no-pager`.
For a source-level dry run, use
`uv run python scripts/cc-pr-review-dispatch.py --pr <PR_NUMBER>`.

`cc-pr-autoqueue` fails closed: a PR must be linked to exactly one cc-task, the
task must carry AuthorityCase/parent-spec metadata plus
`route_metadata_schema: 1`, and the PR must not be draft, held, dirty, failed,
already queued, or already auto-merge-armed. Green PRs are added to the merge
queue; governed PRs with pending checks but no failures are armed with
GitHub auto-merge so branch protection and the merge queue perform the final
merge when requirements pass. Killswitch:
`HAPAX_CC_PR_AUTOQUEUE_OFF=1` or the broader `HAPAX_CC_HYGIENE_OFF=1`.

## Development

For development, stop systemd services and use process-compose:

```bash
systemctl --user stop logos-api hapax-daimonion visual-layer-aggregator studio-compositor
process-compose up           # TUI mode
process-compose attach       # attach to running instance
```

See `process-compose.yaml` (development only, not in boot chain).

## Auto-Rebuild on Main Advance

Two timers poll `origin/main` every 5 minutes and rebuild/restart services when relevant files change. Notifications go to ntfy topic `hapax-build` on `localhost:8090`.

### Rust Binaries (`hapax-rebuild-logos.timer`)

`scripts/rebuild-logos.sh` — compatibility timer name; fetches main, compares SHA to `~/.cache/hapax/rebuild/last-build-sha`, builds and installs only `hapax-imagination`, then restarts `hapax-imagination.service` if the running binary is stale. It intentionally does not build, install, or restart the decommissioned Tauri/WebKit `hapax-logos` runtime.

### Python Services (`hapax-rebuild-services.timer`)

`scripts/rebuild-service.sh` — generic script accepting `--repo`, `--service`, `--watch`, `--sha-key`, `--pull-only`. Council service entries run against the dedicated rebuild worktree at `~/.cache/hapax/rebuild/worktree`, not the operator's interactive `~/projects/hapax-council` checkout. The script creates that worktree on first use, resets it to `origin/main` at the start of every run, checks whether watched paths changed between the last deployed SHA and current `origin/main`, and only restarts the service if relevant files differ.

| Service | Repo | Watched Paths | SHA Key |
|---------|------|---------------|---------|
| `hapax-daimonion.service` | hapax-council | `agents/hapax_daimonion/` `shared/` | `voice` |
| `logos-api.service` | hapax-council | `logos/` | `logos-api` |
| `officium-api.service` | hapax-officium | (entire repo) | `officium` |
| hapax-mcp (pull-only) | hapax-mcp | (entire repo) | `hapax-mcp` |

SHA state files: `~/.cache/hapax/rebuild/last-{key}-sha`.

### Post-Merge Auto-Deploy (`hapax-post-merge-deploy.path`)

`scripts/hapax-post-merge-deploy` covers everything the python-services rebuild
cascade doesn't: systemd unit files, drop-ins, pipewire/wireplumber confs,
release-pinned `scripts/hapax-*` single-link regular copies published by atomic
rename, and helper watchdog binaries. Until 2026-05-03 it
was manual-only; the audit in `cc-task deploy-pipeline-canonical-worktree-isolation`
found 25 systemd units canonical-but-not-installed because nothing fired the
script after merges.

Recheck a release-pinned launcher with
`test -f ~/.local/bin/hapax-post-merge-deploy && test ! -L ~/.local/bin/hapax-post-merge-deploy && test "$(stat -c '%h:%a' ~/.local/bin/hapax-post-merge-deploy)" = 1:755 && cmp -s ~/.cache/hapax/source-activation/worktree/scripts/hapax-post-merge-deploy ~/.local/bin/hapax-post-merge-deploy`.

`hapax-post-merge-deploy.path` watches the canonical local main ref
(`/home/hapax/projects/hapax-council/.git/refs/heads/main`). The dedicated
rebuild worktree shares that ref namespace with the canonical checkout, so when
`rebuild-service.sh` advances local main to `origin/main` the path unit fires
`hapax-post-merge-deploy.service`, which resolves the new HEAD SHA and invokes
the script.

Loop-safety: the deploy script writes directly to deploy destinations:
`~/.config/systemd/user/`, `~/.config/systemd/user-preset/`,
`~/.config/pipewire/`, `~/.config/wireplumber/`, `~/.config/hapax/`,
`~/.local/bin/`, `~/.local/share/wireplumber/scripts/hapax/`,
`~/.local/lib/hapax-recovery/council/`, the canonical gate destination under
`~/.local/lib/hapax/hooks/`, `~/.cache/hapax/post-merge-traces/`, and
`~/.cache/hapax/deploy-symlink-drift/`. When it delegates active coord staging
before restarting `hapax-coord.service`, `hapax-coord-deploy` also writes
`~/.cache/hapax/coord-activation/` and fetches refs inside
`HAPAX_COORD_DEPLOY_REPO` (default `/home/hapax/projects/hapax-coord`). Recheck
the inventory with
`rg -n "PW_CONF_DIR|HAPAX_CONF_DIR|WP_CONF_DIR|WP_SCRIPTS_DIR|SYSTEMD_USER_DIR|SYSTEMD_USER_PRESET_DIR|LOCAL_BIN|TRACE_PATH|HAPAX_DRIFT_STATE_DIR|coord-activation|HAPAX_COORD_DEPLOY_REPO|hapax-recovery|hooks-doctor" scripts/hapax-post-merge-deploy scripts/hapax-coord-deploy`.
The deploy script itself never touches council `.git/refs`. Belt-and-braces:
`StartLimitIntervalSec=60` / `StartLimitBurst=3` on the `[Unit]` section caps
runaway fires. Failures route through `OnFailure=notify-failure@%n.service`.
Trace inspection is documented at `docs/runbooks/post-merge-traces.md`.

Bootstrap: the path unit is canonical at `systemd/units/hapax-post-merge-deploy.path`;
the operator must `systemctl --user enable --now hapax-post-merge-deploy.path` once
after the deploy script's normal install step copies the units in place. From the
next merge onward the chain self-hosts.

### Audio Config Naming

Deployable hand-authored PipeWire files under `config/pipewire/*.conf`
must be named `hapax-*.conf`. This keeps post-merge deploy traces,
operator copies into `~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/`, and grep
queries deterministic. `scripts/check-audio-conf-names.py` enforces the
rule in pre-commit for top-level PipeWire confs; generated compiler
artifacts under `config/pipewire/generated/` keep the audio-routing
compiler's node-id filename convention.

`systemd/overrides/**` contains source/rationale and historical snapshots only;
`hapax-post-merge-deploy` intentionally does not install it. In particular, the
three `OOMScoreAdjust=-900` PipeWire override snapshots there are non-deployable
evidence from the former design. The authoritative deployable drop-ins live
under `systemd/units/{pipewire,pipewire-pulse,wireplumber}.service.d/`, configure
the valid delegated score `100`, and pair it with source-controlled
`MemoryLow=`/`MemoryMin=` reservations. The former root timer bridge to a live
score of `-900` is retired.

## Storage Management

Automated systems prevent disk exhaustion:

### Cache Cleanup (`cache-cleanup.timer` — weekly Sun 03:00)

Prunes reproducible caches: Docker build cache (168h+), dangling images, uv cache, pacman cache, stale worktree `.venv` dirs (7d+), leaked wav files in `/tmp` and `~/.cache/hapax/tmp-wav/`, Chrome crash reports, `__pycache__` (7d+), perception logs (7d), systemd journal (7d).

### Worktree GC (`hapax-worktree-gc.timer` — every 6h)

Runs `scripts/hapax-worktree-gc.sh` against the canonical council checkout.
It removes non-primary git worktrees older than 48h only when their branch is
merged into `origin/main` and the worktree has no uncommitted or untracked
changes. Worktrees older than 7d whose branches are not merged are left in
place and reported to ntfy topic `hapax-worktree-gc` for manual review.

### Ryzen pin-glitch watchdog (`hapax-pin-check.timer` — every 120s)

The Ryzen HDA codec's pin multiplexer silently desynchronises from
PipeWire after a restart that enumerates a new USB audio device
(operator report 2026-04-20: S-4 plug-in). `pactl` reports the sink
RUNNING + unmuted but physical output stays silent until the card
profile is toggled off and back on.

`scripts/hapax-pin-check-probe.sh` (driven by `hapax-pin-check.timer`,
120s cadence) reads the sink's State + active-input count + monitor
RMS dB on every tick and hands the probe to `hapax-audio-topology
pin-check`. The CLI's stateful detector accumulates silent ticks in
`/run/user/$UID/hapax-pin-glitch-state.json`; when 5 s of sustained
RUNNING-but-silent crosses the threshold, `--auto-fix` invokes the
known-good recovery (`pactl set-card-profile … off → output:analog-stereo`).

Install:

```fish
install -m644 systemd/units/hapax-pin-check.service \
    ~/.config/systemd/user/hapax-pin-check.service
install -m644 systemd/units/hapax-pin-check.timer \
    ~/.config/systemd/user/hapax-pin-check.timer
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now hapax-pin-check.timer
```

Override defaults via env (typically in `~/.config/environment.d/`):
`HAPAX_PIN_CHECK_SINK`, `HAPAX_PIN_CHECK_CARD`, `HAPAX_PIN_CHECK_PROFILE`,
`HAPAX_PIN_CHECK_AUTO_FIX` (default 1), `HAPAX_PIN_CHECK_CAPTURE_S` (0.5).

Detection module: `shared/audio_pin_glitch.py`. CLI subcommand:
`scripts/hapax-audio-topology pin-check`. Memory:
`reference_ryzen_codec_pin_glitch`.

### Webcam USB-audio suppression (cc-task audio-audit-O1)

All council webcams (Logitech BRIO `046d:085e`, C920 PRO `046d:08e5`, C920 HD
Pro `046d:082d`) expose a USB-audio interface that the studio never uses —
video is ingested via V4L2 only and the operator's mic chain is the Studio
24c plus the Cortado MKIII contact mic. Auditor A (audit-2026-05-02 finding
#9) flagged the unused `alsa_card.usb-…Logi` cards as an xhci-jitter and
USB-isoc-bandwidth tax (overlaps with O3b territory).

Suppression is via `config/udev/rules.d/56-hapax-webcam-audio-suppress.rules`,
which scopes `ENV{PULSE_IGNORE}=1` to `bInterfaceClass==01` (USB-Audio
class) only — the video interface (class `0e`) is untouched, so studio-
compositor V4L2 ingest is unaffected. Each rule line carries an
`ENV{ID_HAPAX_AUDIO_SUPPRESSED}` marker (`brio`, `c920-pro`, `c920-hd-pro`)
so `udevadm info /dev/...` reports which device a suppression came from.

Install: `bash scripts/install-webcam-audio-suppress-udev.sh` (sudo). Verify
with `pactl list cards short | grep -i 'alsa_card\.usb.*Logi'` — empty output
means the rule is live. Regression pin: `tests/scripts/test_webcam_audio_suppress_udev.py`.

### CLAUDE.md Audit (`claude-md-audit.timer` — monthly)

Runs `scripts/monthly-claude-md-audit.sh` on a monthly cadence. Sweeps every workspace CLAUDE.md (council beta worktree + sibling repos + workspace root + dotfiles symlinks) through `check-claude-md-rot.sh` (default + `--strict`) and `check-vscode-sister-extensions.sh`. Posts to ntfy on findings; silent on success. Operator can run by hand at any time. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-13-claude-md-excellence-design.md`.

### Backups (local plus critical offsite)

| Tier | Timer | Destination | Tool |
|------|-------|-------------|------|
| Local | `hapax-backup-local.timer` daily 03:00 | `/mnt/nas/backups/restic` | restic |
| Critical offsite | `hapax-backup-gdrive-critical.timer` daily 04:35 | `rclone:gdrive:hapax-backups/restic-critical` | restic + rclone → Google Drive |

The local tier backs up PostgreSQL dumps, Qdrant snapshots, n8n workflows,
Docker volume metadata, git bundles, systemd configs, user configs, LLM stack,
and system files.

The GDrive critical lane is intentionally narrower. It backs up already
materialized Postgres PITR artifacts, latest Qdrant snapshot files, and selected
vault evidence/SOP artifacts after broad Backblaze B2 was retired by operator
policy on 2026-06-06. It does
not create Qdrant snapshots, dump databases into `/tmp`, upload live MinIO, or
run destructive restic prune.

`llm-backup.timer` is retained only as a deprecated compatibility receipt. It
does not produce backup artifacts; it points at the local/GDrive lanes above.
Restore details: `docs/runbooks/llm-stack-backup-reconciliation.md`.

Secrets: local password in `pass show backups/restic-password`; current GDrive
critical repo password remains in `pass show backblaze/restic-password` until a
separate credential-rename task changes custody.

### Minio Object Lifecycle

Langfuse writes trace events and media to the `langfuse` minio bucket on `/data`. Without a lifecycle policy, objects accumulate indefinitely and can exhaust ext4 inodes (21M+ objects observed in April 2026 incident, causing ENOSPC on `/data` which broke backups and all services writing to that partition).

**Prevention:** A 14-day lifecycle rule is configured on the `events/` prefix:

```bash
docker exec minio mc alias set L http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
docker exec minio mc ilm rule list L/langfuse   # verify
docker exec minio mc ilm rule add L/langfuse --prefix "events/" --expire-days 14  # recreate if needed
```

Trace metadata survives in ClickHouse/Postgres — only raw event blobs expire. Monitor inode usage: `df -i /data`.

### Known Leak Sources

- **album-identifier pw-cat**: The album identifier records audio clips via `pw-cat` to `/tmp/*.wav` for Shazam-style fingerprinting. Fixed (commit `6c58ca75b`) to use `finally` cleanup. Previously leaked orphan wavs on every early-return path, filling `/tmp` (32G tmpfs) within hours. `tmp-monitor.timer` (5-min) acts as a safety net, deleting wav/raw/pcm files older than 5 min.
- **pacat --record**: Voice daemon's audio capture backends spawn `pacat` subprocesses that can orphan on crash/OOM. Each writes an unbounded WAV file (~7GB before detection). Mitigated by cache-cleanup.
- **Claude Code task output**: Background task output in `/tmp/claude-1000/` can grow unbounded. Not automatically cleaned — monitor `/tmp` usage.

## Disabled Services (archival pipeline)

The following services and timers are disabled (2026-03-27). They supported 24/7 audio/video recording, classification, and RAG ingestion — purely archival with no live consumers. The live perception and effects pipeline (compositor, VLA, fx, person detector) is unaffected as it captures directly from cameras and PipeWire.

**LRR Phase 2 item 1 scope (2026-04-15):** the archival pipeline is partially re-enabled under the *archive-as-research-instrument* framing per `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-15-lrr-phase-2-archive-research-instrument-design.md` §3.1 + §4 decision 3. Scope is narrowed to **audio recording only** — classification, cross-modal correlation, and RAG ingest remain disabled and are deferred to LRR Phase 5+.

| Unit | Purpose | LRR Phase 2 scope | Re-enable with |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| `audio-recorder.service` | Blue Yeti → FLAC archival | **in-scope (Phase 2 item 1)** | `systemctl --user enable --now audio-recorder` |
| `contact-mic-recorder.service` | Cortado → FLAC archival | **in-scope (Phase 2 item 1)** | `systemctl --user enable --now contact-mic-recorder` |
| `rag-ingest.service` | Document watchdog → Qdrant | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (§4 decision 3) | `systemctl --user enable --now rag-ingest` |
| `audio-processor.timer` | FLAC classify → RAG docs | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (classification) | `systemctl --user enable --now audio-processor.timer` |
| `video-processor.timer` | MKV classify → sidecars | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (classification) | `systemctl --user enable --now video-processor.timer` |
| `av-correlator.timer` | Cross-modal → studio_moments | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (cross-modal) | `systemctl --user enable --now av-correlator.timer` |
| `flow-journal.timer` | Flow transitions → RAG docs | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (RAG) | `systemctl --user enable --now flow-journal.timer` |
| `video-retention.timer` | Prune old MKV segments | DEFERRED to Phase 5+ (retention policy TBD) | `systemctl --user enable --now video-retention.timer` |

### LRR Phase 2 item 1 activation — operator runs manually

The two in-scope services (`audio-recorder`, `contact-mic-recorder`) are **ratified for re-enablement but NOT auto-enabled by this commit**. Starting audio recording is an operational change against live hardware (Blue Yeti + Cortado MKIII contact mic) that should happen under operator consent in a moment of the operator's choosing, not at merge time.

Operator activation sequence after this commit merges:

```bash
# Pre-check — hardware available, disk has headroom for FLAC at ~1.4 GB/day per mic
pactl list short sources | grep -E 'Yeti|Contact'
df -h ~/audio-recording

# Enable + start the two in-scope services
systemctl --user enable --now audio-recorder.service
systemctl --user enable --now contact-mic-recorder.service

# Verify each starts cleanly
systemctl --user status audio-recorder.service contact-mic-recorder.service

# Watch the first FLAC segment land
ls -lt ~/audio-recording/raw/ | head -5
journalctl --user -u audio-recorder.service -n 30
journalctl --user -u contact-mic-recorder.service -n 30
```

Rollback if either service fails its first run:

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now audio-recorder.service
systemctl --user disable --now contact-mic-recorder.service
```

The 6 DEFERRED services (classification, cross-modal, RAG, retention) remain untouched by LRR Phase 2. They re-enable under a future LRR Phase 5+ decision after the classifier model, Qdrant cardinality budget, and retention policy decisions land.

## Recovery

The system is configured for 24/7 unattended operation:

- **Kernel panic** → auto-reboot in 10s (`kernel.panic=10`, `softlockup_panic=1`, `hung_task_panic=1`)
- **systemd hang** → hardware watchdog reset in 30s (SP5100 TCO, `RuntimeWatchdogSec=30`)
- **Shutdown hang** → hardware watchdog reset in 10min (`RebootWatchdogSec=10min`)
- **Display manager** → greetd autologin (no password prompt)
- **User services** → lingering enabled, all services start at boot without login
- **Docker containers** → `restart: always` on all 13 containers
- **Service crash** → `Restart=always` or `Restart=on-failure` with rate limiting
- **Journal persistence** → `SyncIntervalSec=15s`, `ForwardToKMsg=yes`, pstore for crash dumps
