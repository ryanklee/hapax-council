"""Reverie affordance registration — imports from centralized shared registry.

The system discovers which visual effects are relevant to each impingement
via cosine similarity in Qdrant, not prescribed semantic mappings.

Reverie indexes ALL system affordances into its pipeline (SCM Property 1 —
each daemon maintains its own view). This enables recruitment from the full
world, not just Reverie-internal capabilities.
