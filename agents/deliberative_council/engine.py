# default UsageLimits leaves ``tool_calls_limit=None`` (UNBOUNDED): a member ran
# 1124 tool calls in one GATE-1 run before the 120s wall-clock timeout fired,
# producing an empty "Phase 1 failure" (TimeoutError) and budget exhaustion.
# Every member call is now EXPLICITLY bounded; ``retries=0`` is set at Agent
# construction (members.py) so a non-conforming structured output fails loud
# instead of silently retrying.
#
# Research pass: a member needs a few rounds of tool calls to verify a claim,
# never hundreds. Scoring pass: a single provider-enforced structured answer
# with NO tools (tool_calls_limit=0). FLAGGED: these caps are deliberately
# generous-but-finite — tune via the tool_calls_log if a healthy member
# legitimately needs more research depth.
# tool_calls_limit raised 8 -> 12 -> 20 (request 6 -> 8 -> 20) per the live
# seg-prep journal (2026-06-11 23:39): healthy members needed 9-11 research tool
# calls (opus=9, balanced=10, mistral=11, web-research=9); cap=8 then cap=12
# still forced deeper-grounding members over-limit -> discarded -> members_valid
# below floor 4 -> 0 segments released. Paired with the graceful cap-handling
# below (a member that hits the budget now SCORES with the research it has rather
# than being discarded), 20/20 gives ample headroom without sacrificing the floor.
# The FLAGGED comment above invites further tuning via the tool_calls_log.
