"""Consent live-egress gate — RETIRED by default.

Originally Phase 6 of the volitional-director epic (PR #1017, spec §5 Phase 6),
hardened to fail-closed in Epic 2 Phase A2.

**Retired 2026-04-18:** the face-obscure pipeline (#129) now masks every
camera frame with a Gruvbox-dark pixelation veneer OR full-frame fill at
capture time — BEFORE any tee to RTMP/HLS/V4L2 egress. The face-obscure
fail-closed pipeline is strictly stronger than this layout-swap gate:
it guarantees no un-obscured camera pixel reaches egress, while the
layout swap merely hid camera sources + ward PiPs at the compositor
level (redundant once face-obscure is authoritative).

Axiom `it-irreversible-broadcast` and `interpersonal_transparency` are
now honored at the face-obscure layer, not at the compositor layout
layer. Consent contracts (principal-c1, principal-c2, principal-a1, …) continue to govern
audio + transcription + interaction recording — those do NOT pass
through face-obscure and retain full consent-contract enforcement.

**Default behavior flipped:** gate is DISABLED by default. Set
``HAPAX_CONSENT_EGRESS_GATE=1|true|on|enabled`` to restore legacy
fail-closed layout-swap behavior. Rationale + governance:
``docs/governance/consent-safe-gate-retirement.md``.

See also: #129 face-obscure spec, ``shared/consent.py``,
``axioms/contracts/``.
