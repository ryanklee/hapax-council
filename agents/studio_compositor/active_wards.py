"""Active-wards observer — publishes currently-rendering ward IDs.

Phase 3.5 foundation companion to ``ward_claim_bindings``. Producers
(cairo overlay draw cycles, source registry transitions, layout swaps)
call ``publish`` with the live set of ward IDs. Consumers (Phase 3.5
Layer C director envelope, post-#1437 follow-up) call ``read`` to
discover which wards' claim providers should contribute posterior
badges to the next LLM prompt.

## File contract

Single JSON object at ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/active_wards.json``::

    {
      "ward_ids": ["album-cover", "splat-attribution-v1", "youtube-slot-0"],
      "published_t": 1745604000.123
    }

``ward_ids`` is unordered; consumers may sort. ``published_t`` is the
producer's clock; ``read`` checks staleness against
``ACTIVE_WARDS_STALE_S`` (default 5s) and treats stale data as
"no active wards" rather than serving the last known list — a stalled
producer should not freeze the consumer's view.

## Atomic write

``publish`` writes to ``active_wards.json.tmp`` then ``os.rename``-s
into place. Concurrent readers see either the old file or the new one,
never a partial write.

## Why a file (vs in-process state)

The compositor process publishes; the director-loop process consumes.
SHM-file IPC matches the project's existing snapshot.jpg / fx-snapshot.jpg
/ perception-state.json patterns and survives crashes of either side.
