"""Ward property cache + SHM I/O — per-ward modulation surface.

The :class:`WardProperties` dataclass collects the nine modulation
dimensions (size, shape, appearance, highlighting, transitions, staging,
dynamism, movement, choreography) into one value object. The on-disk
format is a single JSON file at
``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/ward-properties.json`` keyed by ward_id, with
``"all"`` as a fallback that ward-specific entries override.

Read path: :func:`resolve_ward_properties` is the hot-path entry. It
caches the parsed file with a 200ms TTL so a sub-2ms cairooverlay
callback can call it freely. Expired per-ward overrides (TTL-based) are
discarded at read time.

Write path: :func:`set_ward_properties` performs an atomic upsert
(tmp+rename, same idiom as ``compositional_consumer``). Writers are the
``ward.*`` dispatchers in :mod:`compositional_consumer`.

Render path (cascade-delta 2026-04-18, operator directive
"deeply felt and in-your-face impact"): :func:`ward_render_scope` wraps
every HOMAGE-participating Cairo source and now applies the emphasis
envelope (glow_radius_px, border_pulse_hz, scale_bump_pct) on top of
the source's content. Without this, structural-intent emphasis writes
to ward-properties.json were silently dropped at render time — the
surface still looked like "flat text-on-black rectangles" even when
the director was actively bumping emphasis every tick. The scope now
renders the source into a group, then overlays a radial glow + pulsing
border + optional scale bump, so emphasized wards visibly shimmer.
