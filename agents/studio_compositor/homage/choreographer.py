"""Choreographer — reconciles pending HOMAGE transitions against concurrency.

HOMAGE spec §4.9. The single arbiter of "nothing plopped or pasted":
every ward transition goes through this module. Reads pending moves
from ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/homage-pending-transitions.json``,
applies the package's concurrency rules, emits the ordered plan via
``animation_engine.append_transitions`` (Phase 11+ consumes), and
publishes the 4-float shader coupling payload into
``/dev/shm/hapax-imagination/uniforms.json``.

Feature-flag: as of Phase 12 (task #120, 2026-04-18) the flag defaults
to ON. Setting ``HAPAX_HOMAGE_ACTIVE=0`` (or any falsy value: ``false``,
``no``, ``off``) short-circuits ``reconcile()`` back to the legacy
paint-and-hold path for emergency rollback.

Observability counters are emitted from
``shared/director_observability.py`` so the per-condition slicing
machinery already in place extends unchanged.
