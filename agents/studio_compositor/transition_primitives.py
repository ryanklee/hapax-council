"""Transition primitives — the visual moves between two preset graphs.

Phase 7 of the preset-variety plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-preset-variety-plan.md`).
Each primitive takes the outgoing graph (may be ``None`` when no preset
is currently active) and the incoming graph, plus a ``writer`` callback
that takes a graph dict and mutates the live ``graph-mutation.json``
SHM file, plus a ``sleep`` callback so tests can run zero-cost. The
primitive is responsible for its own per-step pacing.

Five primitives cover the chain-level transition vocabulary
(research §5.5):

- ``fade_smooth`` — 12-step brightness crossfade, the historical default
- ``cut_hard`` — single-frame swap, no intermediate state
- ``netsplit_burst`` — fast clear-to-black + brief hold + sharp re-fill
- ``ticker_scroll`` — sigmoid (S-curve) brightness ramp, perceptually
  distinct from the linear ``fade_smooth`` (slow start + slow end)
- ``dither_noise`` — high-frequency alternation between out and in
  graphs over several short steps before settling on in

All primitives are deterministic given fixed timing — the only
non-determinism is wall-clock ``sleep`` resolution under load. Tests
inject a capture-writer + no-op sleep and assert the expected
sequence of graph mutations.

Visual goal: each primitive should be distinguishable on /dev/video42
within ~1s of observation. Brightness curves below are tuned so the
perceptual signature differs even when two primitives share the
underlying brightness-scaling mechanism.
