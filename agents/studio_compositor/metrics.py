"""In-process Prometheus exporter for the studio compositor.

Phase 4 of the camera 24/7 resilience epic.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-12-v4l2-prometheus-exporter-design.md

Exposes per-camera frame flow, kernel-level drop counts, state machine
transitions, reconnect attempts, compositor uptime, and (pre-reserved for
Phase 5) RTMP metrics on a small HTTP endpoint for the workstation's
existing Docker Prometheus container to scrape via host-gateway.

Thread model: pad probes execute on producer streaming threads; state
transition callbacks execute on the GLib main loop; the poll loop runs
on its own background thread. prometheus_client Counter/Gauge are
internally thread-safe, and the tracker dicts are guarded by a module-
level lock.
