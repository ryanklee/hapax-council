"""Preset cycling — family-biased when director recruits, neutral fallback otherwise.

Phase 3 of the volitional-director epic (2026-04-18 rewrite of the
historical "random_mode"). The loop name + control file kept for
backward compatibility, but the inner logic no longer picks uniformly
from the entire preset corpus. See :mod:`agents.studio_compositor.preset_family_selector`
for the family-aware selection logic.

Phase 7 of the preset-variety plan (#166): per-chain-change the loop
also picks one of five transition primitives instead of always running
the historical brightness fade. When the director has recruited a
``transition.*`` capability within the cooldown the loop honors it;
otherwise it samples uniformly across the 5 primitives so transition
entropy stays well above the 0.6-bit acceptance bar without an
ordered rotation. See :mod:`agents.studio_compositor.transition_primitives`
for the primitive implementations.
