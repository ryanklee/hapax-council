"""Compositor degraded-count signal publisher.

Followup F3 of the compositor unification epic. Bridges Phase 7's
:class:`BudgetTracker` to the stimmung dimension pipeline by writing
a small JSON signal file at a well-known shared-memory location.

The Visual Layer Aggregator (VLA) and stimmung sync agents already
poll ``/dev/shm/`` signal files for various sub-system health states
(exploration deficit, contact mic activity, IR presence, etc.). F3
adds compositor degradation to that pattern: a single JSON file
with the rolling degradation summary the VLA can consume to gate
SEEKING / shed load / surface a degraded-mode banner.

This module ships the **publisher** (mirrors :func:`publish_costs`
from Phase 7). The VLA-side subscriber that maps the signal into a
stimmung dimension is a separate piece of work and is intentionally
out of scope here — landing the signal first means the operator can
introspect the data immediately and the VLA wiring can iterate
without blocking the data plane.

Schema (one file at ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/degraded.json``):

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "timestamp_ms": 12345.6789,
      "total_skip_count": 17,
      "degraded_source_count": 2,
      "total_active_sources": 6,
      "worst_source": {
        "source_id": "sierpinski-lines",
        "skip_count": 9,
        "last_ms": 12.3,
        "avg_ms": 7.4
      },
      "per_source": {
        "sierpinski-lines": {"skip_count": 9, "last_ms": 12.3, "avg_ms": 7.4},
        "album-overlay":    {"skip_count": 8, "last_ms": 6.1,  "avg_ms": 5.0}
      }
    }

A "degraded source" is one with ``skip_count > 0`` — Phase 7's
definition. The VLA can layer on its own thresholds.
