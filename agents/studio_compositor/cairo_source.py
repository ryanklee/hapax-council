"""CairoSource protocol — content sources that render via Cairo.

A CairoSource subclass owns the per-tick draw logic for a single Cairo
content type (Sierpinski, AlbumOverlay, OverlayZones, TokenPole, etc.).
The CairoSourceRunner wraps it in a daemon background thread and ticks
at the declared cadence, holding the most recently rendered surface
under a lock for synchronous consumers.

Phase 3b of the compositor unification epic. The runner is the polymorphic
mechanism the GStreamer cairooverlay (synchronous) and future wgpu source-
protocol consumers can both read from.
