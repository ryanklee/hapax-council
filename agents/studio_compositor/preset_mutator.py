"""Preset parametric mutation — Phase 1 of the preset variety expansion epic.

Applies bounded numeric jitter to a preset graph's parameters so that
identical stance ticks don't always produce identical visual output.
Family entropy rises from ``log2(family_size)`` toward
``log2(family_size) + log2(N_perceptual)`` where ``N_perceptual`` is the
number of perceptually-distinguishable renditions of the same base
preset (empirically ~4-8 at 15% variance).

**Structure preservation invariant.** The mutator MUST NOT add, remove,
rename, or rewire nodes or edges. Only numeric leaf values inside
``nodes[*].params`` (and ``passes[*].params`` for the alternate preset
shape used by Reverie) change. Strings, enums, booleans, lists, and the
graph topology are copied through untouched.

Phase 2 (temporal modulation) and Phase 3 (multi-family fan-out) live
downstream of this module — see
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-preset-variety-expansion-design.md``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    preset
        Preset graph dict as loaded from ``presets/*.json``. Expected
        shape: ``{"nodes": {name: {"type": ..., "params": {...}}}, "edges": [...], ...}``.
        Alternate shape supported: ``{"passes": [{"params": {...}}, ...]}``
        (used by the Reverie vocabulary plan and the effect-graph v2
        plan schema).
    rng
        Optional pre-seeded ``random.Random`` instance. Callers that
        want deterministic mutation for a given stance tick should pass
        ``Random(stance_tick)`` (or use the ``seed`` kwarg).
    variance
        Maximum fractional deviation per numeric param. Default 0.15
        per spec §3. Values outside ``[0, 1]`` are clamped.
    seed
        Convenience kwarg: if ``rng`` is None and ``seed`` is set, a
        new ``Random(seed)`` is constructed. If both are None, a fresh
        ``Random()`` is used (non-deterministic).

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A NEW preset dict. The input is not mutated in place. Graph
        structure (nodes, edges, topology, modulations) is preserved;
        only numeric leaves inside ``params`` change.
