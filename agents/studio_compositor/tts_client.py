"""Sync TTS client — delegates synthesis to the hapax-daimonion TTS UDS server.

Removes the need to import ``agents.hapax_daimonion.tts`` (and therefore
torch + the full CUDA driver stack) in the compositor process. See
``docs/superpowers/audits/2026-04-13-alpha-finding-1-root-cause.md`` for
the root cause that motivated this split.

Wire format mirrors ``agents.hapax_daimonion.tts_server``:
request is a single ``\\n``-terminated JSON object, response is a
``\\n``-terminated JSON header followed by ``pcm_len`` bytes of raw PCM.
