"""Z-plane depth constants for ward stratification.

Five semantic depth categories layer wards in a notional fishbowl
(scrim spatial design at ``docs/research/2026-04-20-nebulous-scrim-design.md``).
The default ``"on-scrim"`` is the legibility plane and renders without
visible attenuation; deeper planes attenuate via :func:`fx_chain.blit_with_depth`.

Kept as a separate module to avoid a circular import between
:mod:`fx_chain` and :mod:`ward_properties`.
