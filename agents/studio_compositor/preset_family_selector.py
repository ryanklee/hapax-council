"""Preset family selector — Phase 3 of the volitional-director epic.

The director's compositional impingements can recruit ``fx.family.<family>``
capabilities (audio-reactive, calm-textural, glitch-dense, warm-minimal,
neutral-ambient). Stage 1 routing fix (PR #1044) ensures these recruitments
land on the studio compositor's livestream surface rather than getting
hijacked by Reverie satellites. But the recruitment alone only writes the
*family* to ``recent-recruitment.json``; ``random_mode.py`` historically
treated the family bias as a sleep signal ("director claimed this window,
don't pick uniformly") without actually choosing a preset *within* the
family.

This module implements the missing within-family pick. Used by:

- ``random_mode.py`` — when a family is recruited (within the cooldown
  window), defer to ``pick_from_family(family)`` for the next preset
  selection. When NO family is recruited, fall back to
  ``pick_from_family("neutral-ambient")`` rather than uniform random
  across the entire preset corpus.
- Any future deterministic director path that wants "give me a fresh
  preset from family X" without wiring its own random selection.

Family → preset mapping is curated below. The mapping is intentionally
operator-tunable — preset taxonomy is aesthetic, not mechanical, and the
operator's mental model of which presets fit which families is the
authority. Update :data:`FAMILY_PRESETS` to reflect taste evolution.
