"""LRR Phase 9 §3.2 — stimmung-modulated activity selection.

Pure scoring helpers for the director-loop activity selector. Given a
candidate activity (``react`` / ``chat`` / ``vinyl`` / ``study`` /
``observe`` / ``silence``) plus three terms, returns a single number:

    score(a) = momentary_weight · momentary
             + objective_weight · objective_alignment
             + stimmung_weight  · stimmung_term

The weights default to ``0.70 / 0.25 / 0.05`` per spec §3.2 — conservative
start per the §6 oscillation-risk note. The stimmung term is derived
from the published chat-signals SHM (see ``agents/chat_monitor/sink.py``
and PR #998), mapped to a per-activity modulation: high engagement +
many threads lifts ``chat``, low engagement lifts ``study`` / ``silence``.

The module is side-effect-free and injection-friendly. The caller
passes ``momentary`` and ``objective_alignment`` from whatever upstream
logic already has them; ``stimmung_term`` is either supplied directly
or read via ``stimmung_term_for_activity``.
