"""Per-camera last-good-frame cache for freeze-frame fallback (A+ Stage 3).

When a camera drops (USB bus-kick, FSM → DEGRADED → OFFLINE), the
fallback pipeline plays a "no signal" card. ATEM / vMix / pro broadcast
switchers instead freeze the last-good frame. This module is the
shared buffer store that makes that work:

- Each camera's producer pipeline installs a pad probe at its
  interpipesink that snapshots one frame every N ticks into this
  cache (``update``), keyed by camera role.
- The fallback pipeline's ``appsrc`` (replacing the previous
  ``videotestsrc``) reads this cache via ``get`` on its timer tick
  and emits the stored NV12 buffer. If no frame has been captured
  yet, ``get`` returns ``None`` and the fallback emits its pre-baked
  black frame instead.

The cache deliberately stores a SINGLE frame per role (no ring
buffer): fallback is a stop-gap, not a replay system. Memory cost:
1280x720 NV12 = 1.4 MiB × 6 cameras = 8.4 MiB total.
