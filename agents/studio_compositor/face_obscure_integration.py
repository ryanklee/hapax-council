"""Capture-time facial-obscuring entry point (task #129).

Thin function-oriented wrapper that glues the three independently-tested
layers together so ``camera_pipeline.py`` / ``snapshots.py`` can wire the
obscure stage in with a single call:

    from agents.studio_compositor.face_obscure_integration import (
        obscure_frame_for_camera,
    )
    jpeg_in = obscure_frame_for_camera(frame, camera_role="operator")

Reads the feature flag and policy from env on every call via
:func:`shared.face_obscure_policy.resolve_policy` — the layers below the
integration helper stay policy-agnostic so the flag can be toggled at runtime
(systemd ``EnvironmentFile`` reload) without restarting the compositor.

State is kept per-camera in a module-level dict so repeat calls for the same
role share a single SCRFD instance + Kalman buffer. The helper is safe to
call from multiple camera loops concurrently at the python level because
each role has its own pipeline instance; InsightFace's ONNX runtime session
is itself thread-safe for ``run()``.

Stage 2 scope: the bbox source is the real SCRFD detector by default. The
YOLO11n fallback + fail-closed rectangle painter (plan Task 4 / §3.6) is
deferred — the current helper degrades to pass-through if carry-forward
expires, and Stage 3 will upgrade this to a fail-closed full-frame mask.
