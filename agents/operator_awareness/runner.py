"""Awareness state runner — 30s tick that aggregates + atomically writes.

The daemon entry point: every ``tick_s`` seconds, calls
``Aggregator.collect()`` and writes the resulting AwarenessState to
``/dev/shm/hapax-awareness/state.json`` via the atomic writer.

Prometheus metrics:
- ``hapax_awareness_state_writes_total{result}`` — per-tick outcome
- ``hapax_awareness_aggregator_source_failures_total{source}`` —
  per-source failure counter (sources fail individually rather than
  failing the whole tick)

The aggregator already swallows per-source failures; this runner
metric counts ticks where any wired source returned a default-empty
block when its source path existed (e.g. corrupt JSON). For now,
each tick that succeeds at writing increments the writes_total
``ok`` counter; a write failure increments ``error``.

systemd integration: when run under ``Type=notify``, the runner
calls ``sd_notify(READY=1)`` after the first successful tick so
systemd marks the unit active only after state.json exists. Each
subsequent tick pings ``WATCHDOG=1``; pair with ``WatchdogSec=120``
in the unit file and crash-recovery is automatic without external
monitoring scaffolding. Outside systemd (tests, manual run) the
notifier resolves to a no-op, matching the studio-compositor pattern.
