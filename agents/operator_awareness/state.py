"""Awareness state model + atomic writer.

Pydantic types for the 14-category operator-awareness state per the
``awareness-state-stream-canonical`` spec. Each block carries a
``public: bool`` field that
:mod:`agents.operator_awareness.public_filter` consults when fanning
out to the omg.lol public-safe weblog payload.

Anti-anthropomorphization: state payload uses neutral category names
(golden-signal, posterior-decile, count, last-error) — no narrative
prose surfaced from the spine itself.

## Atomic write

Readers must never see partial JSON. ``write_state_atomic`` writes
to a per-pid tmp file then os.replace()s it into place — POSIX
guarantees rename atomicity within the same filesystem (/dev/shm
qualifies).
