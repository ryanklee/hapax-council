"""Public-safe filter for omg.lol fanout (server-side redaction).

Walks an ``AwarenessState`` and zeroes out non-public sub-blocks per
each block's ``public: bool`` flag. The filter is server-side because
trusting any client to honor public flags would leak operator state
on the first misconfigured surface.

The refusals_recent block is special: refusals ARE public-by-design
per the constitutional ``feedback_full_automation_or_no_engagement``
directive (refusal-as-data is celebrated). The list passes through
unchanged regardless of any block-level public flag.
