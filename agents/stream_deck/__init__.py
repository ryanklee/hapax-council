"""Stream Deck control surface (task #140, Phase 1).

Physical hardware surface — 15-key StreamDeck Mini — mapped to the Logos
command registry. The operator presses a key, the adapter resolves the
slot to a ``(command, args)`` pair from ``config/stream-deck/manifest.yaml``,
and dispatches over the existing Tauri WebSocket relay at
``ws://127.0.0.1:8052/ws/commands``.

Phase 1 (this module) ships the adapter layer only. Wiring to the
``streamdeck`` python library is a Phase 2 concern; the probe script
(``scripts/stream-deck-probe.py``) degrades gracefully when the library
or the hardware is absent, so the adapter can be exercised end-to-end
with a mocked dispatcher until hardware lands.
