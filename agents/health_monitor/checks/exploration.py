"""Exploration writer liveness checks.

Each of the 13 wired components (see `Unified Semantic Recruitment §
Exploration -> SEEKING`) publishes an ExplorationSignal JSON to
`/dev/shm/hapax-exploration/{component}.json`. When a writer stalls, the
VLA-consumed aggregate boredom stops updating and the SEEKING stance
transition gate degrades silently. This check catches per-file staleness
> 120s and emits a degraded/failed CheckResult with a targeted remediation.

REGRESSION-2 (2026-04-18): the canonical `stimmung` writer had stalled for
~22h because VLA owned the only StimmungCollector but had
`enable_exploration=False`. The expected-writer map below is the contract
that would have caught it.
