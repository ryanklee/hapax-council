"""Engine-gated activation wrappers — Mode D × voice-tier mutex integration.

Phase 2 of ``docs/research/2026-04-20-mode-d-voice-tier-mutex.md``.
Composes ``shared.evil_pet_state.acquire_engine()`` with the two
capabilities that configure the Evil Pet granular engine:

- ``VocalChainCapability.apply_tier`` — voice tiers 0–6
- ``VinylChainCapability.activate_mode_d`` — vinyl anti-DMCA wash

Why external wrappers instead of embedding the gate in each chain:
keeping the chain modules pure (MIDI emission only) preserves the
composable-primitives architecture and keeps the chain tests free of
SHM filesystem pollution. Production callers (daimonion bootstrap,
director_loop, operator CLI) use these gated wrappers; the ungated
methods remain available for isolated unit tests and Phase 1+ of the
mutex (flag-only, no CC emission) that landed alongside this module.

Behaviour:

- ``apply_tier_gated(chain, tier)`` — acquires the appropriate
  ``voice_tier_N`` mode under ``writer='director'``; on
  ``accepted=False`` the tier is NOT applied (no CC emission, no
  state mutation on the chain). Caller inspects the returned
  ``ArbitrationResult`` for logging/telemetry.
- ``activate_mode_d_gated(chain)`` — acquires ``mode_d`` under the
  caller-supplied writer (operator explicit or programme opt-in).
  On block, Mode D is not engaged.
- ``deactivate_mode_d_gated(chain)`` — transitions to ``bypass``
  through the same arbitration so a writer with sufficient authority
  can always release the engine. On success, the legacy flag is
  cleared by ``write_state`` as a side effect.

Telemetry: every call emits a single ``log.info`` or ``log.debug``
line with from/to/writer/reason. No Prometheus metrics in this phase;
the counters described in research §7 land alongside the director-
loop integration in Phase 3.

            a Programme that has opted in to a T5/T6 excursion.
