"""MoodArousalEngine — Phase 6b-i.A mood-claim Bayesian wrapper.

Per Universal Bayesian Claim-Confidence research §Phase 6b ("Mood claims
— stimmung dimensions, each becomes a `ClaimEngine[float]` with continuous
posterior"): mood-claims benefit from posterior framing — `P(mood is
high-arousal | observed_signals)` — over ad-hoc threshold gates on the
stimmung dimensions themselves. This module ships the first such engine
in the cluster (alpha-canonical lane per beta dispatch 02:18Z) using the
quantize-into-tiers approach (option 1): `ClaimEngine[bool]` over a
quantized arousal tier. Continuous-posterior `ClaimEngine[float]` lands
in Phase 6b-i.B if option 1 proves insufficient.

Mirrors SystemDegradedEngine (#1357) and SpeakerIsOperatorEngine (#1355):
- ``ClaimEngine[bool]`` internal delegate
- Symmetric-ish ``TemporalProfile`` (k_enter=3, k_exit=4 — mood shifts
  more readily in both directions than presence or degradation, but
  arousal-asserting events still get a slight head start over recovery)
- ``LRDerivation``-typed signal weights (HPX003 compliant)
- Prior provenance ref into ``shared/prior_provenance.yaml`` (HPX004)
- ``HAPAX_BAYESIAN_BYPASS=1`` flows through the engine automatically

Phase 6b-i.A scope (this PR): module + signal contract + tests + prior
provenance entry. Phase 6b-i.B (deferred): wire the four signal sources
into a perception adapter + add the consumer wire-in. Phase 6b-i.C may
extend to additional mood dimensions (mood_valence_negative,
mood_coherence_low) following the same template.
