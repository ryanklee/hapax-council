"""Impingement adapter -- routes internal events through CPAL control loop.

Impingements are not separate from conversation. They modulate the
control loop by adjusting gain and contributing error. A critical
system alert raises gain and produces high error. A mild imagination
fragment gently nudges gain and produces low error.

Scope: this adapter owns only gain/error modulation and the
``should_surface`` gate that triggers ``generate_spontaneous_speech``
from ``CpalRunner.process_impingement``. Other recruited-affordance
dispatch (notification delivery, Thompson learning for studio/world
recruitment, cross-modal ``ExpressionCoordinator`` coordination,
``_system_awareness`` and ``_discovery_handler`` activation) lives in
``agents.hapax_daimonion.run_loops_aux.impingement_consumer_loop``,
which is spawned as a separate background task next to the CPAL
impingement loop in ``run_inner.py``. Apperception cascade is owned by
``shared.apperception_tick.ApperceptionTick`` inside the visual-layer
aggregator. An earlier version of this docstring claimed this adapter
"Replaces: SpeechProductionCapability, impingement_consumer_loop
routing, ..." — that claim was incorrect and caused those downstream
effects to go silently dead after PR #555.
