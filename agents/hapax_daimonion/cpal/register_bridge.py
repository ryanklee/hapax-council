"""CPAL voice-register bridge -- HOMAGE Phase 7.

The choreographer writes the active HOMAGE package's ``voice_register_default``
to ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/homage-voice-register.json`` on every package
swap (including the consent-safe fallback). CPAL reads it here before each
TTS emission so tonal register tracks the visual lineage without either side
having to import the other's types.

Behaviour contract (spec §4.8, task brief task #113):

* Missing file → fall through to ``DEFAULT_REGISTER`` (``CONVERSING``).
* Stale file (>``_STALE_AFTER_S``) → fall through to ``DEFAULT_REGISTER``.
  A stale file means the choreographer stopped updating the register (dead
  compositor, or a rollback wipe); we refuse to honour a frozen value.
* Fresh file with a known register value → return that register.
* Fresh file with an unknown / malformed payload → fall through to
  ``DEFAULT_REGISTER``. Fail-open: we never raise from the bridge because
  CPAL's TTS path must not be gated by a corrupt SHM file.

A 250ms in-process cache prevents the CPAL tick (~150ms) from polling the
filesystem every emission; the cache is short enough that a fresh package
swap lands within one CPAL frame.

The register flows one way: choreographer → SHM → CPAL. CPAL never writes
this file. The consumer reads; the producer writes. See spec §4.8 and
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-homage-framework-design.md``.
