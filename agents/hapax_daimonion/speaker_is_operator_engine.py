"""SpeakerIsOperatorEngine — Bayesian Phase 6c-i identity claim.

Wraps :class:`shared.claim.ClaimEngine[bool]` to express the identity
claim ``speaker_is_operator`` with calibrated posterior + hysteresis.

Surface migrated from: ``agents/hapax_daimonion/perception_loop.py:214``,
which previously produced a raw ``bool`` from the session.speaker
check. The raw signal flips on/off instantly with session state; the
ClaimEngine wrapper adds:

  * **Asymmetric temporal profile** — fast-enter (operator speaks → assert
    immediately, ``k_enter=2``) / slow-exit (silence ≠ absence,
    ``k_exit=10``). A brief pause from the operator does not flip the
    posterior; a sustained silence does.
  * **Calibrated posterior** — single signal but full Bayesian framing
    so future sub-signals (voice biometric match, IR overlap with desk
    zone, contact-mic-keystroke-during-utterance) compose cleanly via
    the ``LRDerivation`` registry.
  * **Hysteresis state machine** — ``ASSERTED`` / ``UNCERTAIN`` /
    ``RETRACTED``, mirroring :class:`PresenceEngine`'s pattern.

Phase 6c-i.A (this module) ships the engine. Phase 6c-i.B wires it into
``perception_loop._tick_consent`` to replace the raw bool consumer.
Staged for cleaner audit + revertability — same pattern as Phase 5
module first / Phase 6 wiring later.

Spec: ``docs/research/2026-04-24-universal-bayesian-claim-confidence.md``.
v3-final dispatch: epsilon-canonical Phase 6c.
Scope direction: ``~/.cache/hapax/relay/beta-to-epsilon-2026-04-25-phase-6c-scope-direction.md``.

    Initial-tick semantics: starts at ``UNCERTAIN`` with posterior

    consecutive ticks above the enter_threshold (per the temporal
    profile); it remains ``ASSERTED`` until 10 consecutive ticks below

    False) does NOT retract the assertion — by design.
