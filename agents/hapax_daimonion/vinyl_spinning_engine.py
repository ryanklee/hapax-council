"""Bayesian vinyl-spinning engine — replaces the Boolean ``_vinyl_is_playing``.

Replaces ``agents/studio_compositor/director_loop.py::_vinyl_is_playing``
with a posterior-driven ``ClaimEngine[bool]`` that fuses heterogeneous
signals (operator override flag, album-cover identification + freshness,
hand-on-turntable IR perception, future YAMNet audio classification)
into a calibrated probability, with per-claim asymmetric temporal
hysteresis (slow-enter / fast-exit — vinyl claims should be cautious to
assert, fast to retract).

## Why a Bayesian engine instead of a 3-signal Boolean

The Boolean version had a structural problem: each signal was a hard
short-circuit. When ANY signal fired (operator flag OR album-cover
fresh-AND-hand-recent), the predicate returned True; when none fired
it returned False. This let single-signal weak evidence (e.g., a still-
fresh ALBUM_STATE_FILE from a previous spin even after the operator
removed the album) drive a True even when the actual platter was
silent — the hallucination class operator reported as
"director claiming vinyl playing when it isn't" (Task #185, fixed
tactically in #1208/#1210/#1211/#1220, but the underlying Boolean
predicate kept regressing as new signals were added).

The Bayesian fusion is structural: each signal contributes a likelihood
ratio (LR = P(signal | vinyl_spinning) / P(signal | not_spinning)) per
``LRDerivation``, the engine combines them into a log-odds posterior,
and an asymmetric ``TemporalProfile`` (slow-enter, fast-exit per the
research §6 music profile) prevents both flicker and false-positives.

## Signals

Phase 2 ships with three signals — same set as the Boolean predicate
plus the operator override as a hard-conjunctive lift:

- ``operator_override``: ``/dev/shm/hapax-compositor/vinyl-operator-active.flag``
  exists. Hard-positive (LR ≈ 100/0.01) — operator-asserted ground truth.
- ``album_cover_fresh``: ALBUM_STATE_FILE exists, mtime within
  ``_VINYL_STATE_STALE_S`` (300s), and confidence ≥
  ``_VINYL_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`` (0.5). Necessary-but-not-sufficient
  — the album-identifier writes state when the cover is in the IR
  field even if the platter idles. LR moderate (0.6 / 0.3).
- ``hand_on_turntable``: Pi-6 IR overhead camera saw a hand in the
  turntable zone within ``_TURNTABLE_ACTIVE_STALE_S`` (120s) OR
  scratching/scratch activity classified by contact_mic_ir cross-
  modal fusion. Strong corroboration when present, weak absence
  signal (operator may have set the platter spinning then walked
  away). Positive-only: LR (0.85 / 0.10).

Phase 2b will add ``yamnet_music_present`` (broadcast L-12 audio
classification — pure-audio evidence, zero upstream coupling). That
signal is the structural fix to the third hallucination axis (audio-
silent + cover-fresh + hand-recent → still claims vinyl) but it
lives in a separate engine call site once shipped.

## Temporal profile (asymmetric — research §6 music)

- enter_threshold: 0.75 (require strong evidence to assert)
- exit_threshold: 0.40
- k_enter: 6 (≈6 ticks, cautious entry)
- k_exit: 2 (fast retraction — when the audio drops, claim drops fast)
- k_uncertain: 4 (default)

Rationale: false-positive vinyl claims are operator-perceptible
hallucination (they break the livestream's grounding contract);
false-negative vinyl claims are silent-degrade (the director stops
narrating vinyl correctly, falling back to youtube/curated framing).
Operator's pain is squarely on the false-positive axis, so the
profile is biased to slow-enter / fast-exit.

## Public API

::

    engine = VinylSpinningEngine()
    engine.tick()          # gather signals, update posterior + state
    engine.posterior       # 0..1 calibrated probability
    engine.is_spinning     # bool — True iff state == ASSERTED
    engine.state           # "ASSERTED" | "UNCERTAIN" | "RETRACTED"

## Bypass

When ``HAPAX_BAYESIAN_BYPASS=1`` is set, the underlying ``ClaimEngine``
``update`` is a no-op — posterior pinned to prior, state pinned to
UNCERTAIN. Combined with a caller-side fallback to the legacy Boolean
predicate, this is the single rollback knob for the entire vinyl-
spinning Bayesian layer.
