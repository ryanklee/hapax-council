"""MoodValenceEngine — Phase 6b-ii.A mood-claim Bayesian wrapper.

Per Universal Bayesian Claim-Confidence research §Phase 6b ("Mood
claims — stimmung dimensions, each becomes a `ClaimEngine[float]` with
continuous posterior"): mood-valence benefits from posterior framing
— `P(operator's mood is currently negative-valence | observed_signals)`
— over ad-hoc threshold gates on HRV / skin-temp / sleep readings.
This module ships the second of the Phase 6b cluster (alpha-canonical)
following MoodArousalEngine (#1368) using the quantize-into-tiers
approach (option 1 from beta dispatch 02:18Z): `ClaimEngine[bool]`
over a quantized negative-valence tier. Continuous-posterior
`ClaimEngine[float]` lands later if option 1 proves insufficient.

Mirrors MoodArousalEngine (#1368), SystemDegradedEngine (#1357), and
SpeakerIsOperatorEngine (#1355):
- ``ClaimEngine[bool]`` internal delegate
- Slightly slow-enter / slow-exit ``TemporalProfile`` (k_enter=4,
  k_exit=6 — don't catastrophize on a single low-HRV reading; negative
  mood persists, so recovery to POSITIVE benefits from sustained
  evidence too)
- ``LRDerivation``-typed signal weights (HPX003 compliant)
- Prior provenance ref into ``shared/prior_provenance.yaml`` (HPX004)
- ``HAPAX_BAYESIAN_BYPASS=1`` flows through the engine automatically

Phase 6b-ii.A scope (this PR): module + signal contract + tests + prior
provenance entry. Phase 6b-ii.B (deferred): wire the four signal sources
into a perception adapter + add the consumer wire-in.
