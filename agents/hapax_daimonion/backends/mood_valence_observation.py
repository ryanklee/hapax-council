"""Health/voice → MoodValenceEngine signal adapter.

Phase 6b-ii.B partial wire-in for the mood-valence claim engine that
#1371 shipped as engine math + signal contract without a live consumer.

Mood-valence signals are sourced from heterogeneous backends (per
``DEFAULT_SIGNAL_WEIGHTS`` in ``mood_valence_engine.py``):

- ``hrv_below_baseline``: Pixel Watch HRV below operator's recent
  baseline (``backends/health.py``; bidirectional)
- ``skin_temp_drop``: Pixel Watch skin temperature drop from baseline
  (``backends/health.py``; positive-only)
- ``sleep_debt_high``: accumulated sleep deficit above tolerance
  threshold (``backends/health.py``; positive-only)
- ``voice_pitch_elevated``: voice pitch elevated above operator's
  session baseline (Kokoro/Whisper-side speech analysis; positive-only)

This adapter exposes a ``mood_valence_observation`` builder that takes
any ``_HealthVoiceValenceSource`` (anything implementing the four
accessors) and returns a single-tick observation dict for
``MoodValenceEngine.contribute()``.

Phase 6b-ii.B Part 1 wires the adapter contract + lifespan scaffolding;
all four signal accessors return ``None`` from the initial bridge until
production thresholds are calibrated. Follow-up PRs land each signal
source — same additive pattern delta used for OAE in #1389 and alpha
used for MAE in #1392.
