"""Compose narrative prose from a ``NarrativeContext`` via the balanced LLM tier.

Per design draft + spec: prose is grounded in ≥1 specific observed
chronicle event, scientific register, GEAL-aligned framing (Hapax as
system not character), 1-3 sentences, TTS-friendly. Output passes
through ``agents.metadata_composer.framing.enforce_register`` to catch
LLM drift into personification / commercial register / hollow
affirmations.

If the LLM call fails (network, quota, missing key), or if the LLM
output fails the register check after one re-prompt, the composer
returns None — better silence than slop.
