"""Hapax persona — system prompts, greetings, notification formatting.

LRR Phase 7 §4.4 integration: prompts are now driven by the description-of-being
document (axioms/persona/hapax-description-of-being.prompt.md) via
shared.persona_prompt_composer, not hard-coded personification strings.

Tool descriptions, voice-mode operational instructions, and the current-partner
declaration are kept inline here — they're infrastructure + task-level
constraints, not description-of-being. Those compose on top of the persona.

Operators can opt out via HAPAX_PERSONA_LEGACY=1 to revert to pre-Phase-7
hard-coded prompts; default is document-driven.
