"""Discourse Unit grounding ledger — tracks grounding state per system utterance.

Implements a simplified Traum (1994) grounding automaton with concern-aware
repair thresholds (Clark & Brennan 1991 "sufficient for current purposes").

The ledger is external to the LLM — it makes mechanical decisions about
when to advance, repair, or abandon based on acceptance signals and concern
weight. The LLM receives the RESULT (a grounding directive) not the logic.

Three core functions:
  1. DU state tracking (PENDING → GROUNDED/REPAIR/ABANDONED/CONTESTED/UNGROUNDED)
  2. Grounding Quality Index (GQI) — composite of acceptance, coherence, engagement
  3. 2D effort calibration (activation × GQI → word limit + effort level)
