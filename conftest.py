"""Root conftest — prevent real notifications and GPU model loading during tests.
This patches:
  1. I/O layer (urlopen, subprocess.run) inside shared.notify — prevents real
     ntfy or desktop notifications.
  2. GPU/ML modules (torch, model2vec, etc.) — prevents VRAM allocation during
     test collection. Without this, tests that transitively import voice/ML
     modules can load models and consume 18+ GiB of VRAM.

Tests that explicitly mock these functions will see their own mocks take
precedence over these session-scoped patches.
