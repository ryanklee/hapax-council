"""Coverage pin for cc-task audit-w4-observability-honesty-20260611.

Exit predicate of the task (audit v2, REPORT.md §observability): **every
S1/S2-constituent systemd unit versioned in this repo has ``OnFailure=``
or a declared probe exemption.** Before this task, ~40 S1/S2-constituent
unit files notified nobody on failure — the audit's universal
"watcher dies silently" class (W4-ONFAILURE-GAP).

The map below is FROZEN from the audit's ex-ante unit registry
(``subsystem-audit-2026-06-11-v2/unit-registry.yaml``, basis 2.1.0,
S1 = live path of segment execution, S2 = segment prep depends on it)
plus the W4 prep-packet gap sweep. Grouping keys are audit subsystem
``unit_id``s; values are the constituent repo unit files in
``systemd/units/``. Units the dossiers did not name explicitly are
attributed by registry ``scope_hint`` keywords and marked in comments.

Maintenance contract:
- Adding a new S1/S2-path unit file? Add it here in the same PR.
- A live mapped unit may only drop ``OnFailure=`` by gaining an entry in
  ``PROBE_EXEMPT`` naming the probe/reason. A parked or retired unit must leave
  the live map and gain an explicit non-live exclusion — never silently.
- Deployed-only units (pipewire/wireplumber system-managed; litellm
  container) are out of scope: this pin covers repo-versioned files.

Freeze verifiability (review round 2, PR #4106): the ex-ante registry
lives in the operator vault (outside the repo), so the map itself is
the reviewable freeze. Known deliberate EXCLUSIONS, with rationale:
- pipewire/wireplumber: system-managed, no repo unit files.
- litellm/qdrant/prometheus: containers; failure visibility is the
  HapaxExporterDown rule, not systemd OnFailure.
- hapax-lane-reaper: parked transitional compatibility observer, not a live
  S1/S2 recovery or notification unit.
- hapax-claude-lane@/hapax-quake-live-camera@ etc. template instances
  whose parent subsystems are S3 in the registry.
Units the registry plausibly implies that earlier drafts MISSED were
added in round 2 (hapax-darkplaces — the live Screwm render surface;
hapax-secrets — root of the secrets→logos-api→tabbyapi→daimonion key
chain; the hapax-screwm-* live-surface trio). If you believe a unit is
S1/S2-constituent and absent here, add it with a comment — the cost of
an extra OnFailure= line is one ntfy; the cost of a miss is a silent
death.
