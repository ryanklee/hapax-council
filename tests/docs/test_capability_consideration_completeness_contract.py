"""Capability-consideration COMPLETENESS gate (REQ-20260619-capability-adapter-unification, P4).

Operator principle (2026-06-19): a *capability* is the FULL descriptor —
``platform x surface x model x effort x context-mode x fast-mode x quantization x
capacity-pool`` — not just the platform. Every capability must be considered WHERE
ANY capability is considered.

This gate makes "considered where any is considered" CHECKABLE and fail-closed.
For each operator-selectable capability axis and each governed consideration site
where that axis is APPLICABLE, the axis must either be STRUCTURALLY MODELED at that
site (verified by live introspection of the real models/constants — never text
scraping) OR be covered by an explicit, dated, future-expiry WAIVER that names the
cc-task closing it. An axis present at one applicable site but silently absent at
another is the exact defect this gate forbids: intentional gaps are *visible
expiring debt*, never silent absence.

Today (origin/main) reasoning-effort, context-mode (1M), fast-mode, structured
model-identity, and quantization are absent from the governed routing/metering
plane (they live only at launch time — e.g. ``hapax-claude``/``hapax-claude-headless``
defaults, and the smuggled ``model_or_engine="gpt-5.5-xhigh"``). Each absence is a
dated waiver pointing at the cc-task that promotes it. As those tasks land, the
detector flips to MODELED and the matching waiver MUST be removed (``test_waivers_name_real_absences``),
which then forces the axis to be considered at *every* applicable site — the
forcing function.
