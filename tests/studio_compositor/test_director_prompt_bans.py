"""Regression pin: BANNED NARRATION block in director's unified prompt.

Operator directive 2026-04-19: "we are in a holding pattern -- geez! I
wonder whose job it is to NOT BE IN A HOLDING PATTERN!?"

Hapax was caught narrating META-STATE (pipeline status, director state,
system pauses, silence-hold compositional directives) as if those were
audience-appropriate content — reading stage directions to viewers.

This test pins the BANNED NARRATION block + the specific banned phrases
into the assembled prompt so future prompt rewrites don't regress.
