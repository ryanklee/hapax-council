"""Regression pins for the tabbyapi-hermes8b second-instance retirement.

The Hermes 3 8B parallel-pivot was abandoned operator-side on 2026-04-15
(drop #62 §14, commit 2bc6aec17). The systemd unit and drop-in were
retained as audit-trail reference material for several weeks but were
never deployed and never had operator-ratified GPU pinning. Retirement
ratified 2026-04-30 (cc-task ``retire-tabbyapi-hermes8b-audit-unit``).

These pins lock the retirement in:

1. The unit and drop-in are gone from ``systemd/units/`` so
   ``hapax-post-merge-deploy`` does not reinstall them.
2. The unit name is in the ``DECOMMISSIONED_UNITS`` array in
   ``install-units.sh`` so existing linked symlinks (and the linked
   drop-in directory) on already-deployed hosts get cleaned, disabled,
   and masked on next install run.
3. The ``remove_decommissioned_unit`` function in install-units.sh
   handles drop-in directory cleanup, not just top-level symlinks —
   the hermes8b unit shipped with a drop-in and other future
   decommissions may too.
