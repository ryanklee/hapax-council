"""Tests for the roleless-resolver keystone (CASE-ROLE-RESOLUTION-DISAMBIG-001).

Behavioral invariants that close the alpha-phantom-inheritance + push/write split-brain
class. Every assertion here EXECUTES the resolver / emitter / gate rather than grepping
source text — the prior text-match assertions were "coverage theater" (they passed on
string presence regardless of whether the resolver was actually wired at runtime).

Invariants under test:

1. A roleless session NEVER resolves to ``alpha`` — via ``hapax_effective_role`` (the one
   resolver every gate now calls), regardless of git branch or cwd. (FM-1: a worktree's
   branch name is not identity. The old push-gate branch-regex returned ``alpha`` for a
   roleless session on an ``alpha/foo`` branch — the phantom-alpha behind the b111a641
   triple-claim collision.)
2. Cross-consumer agreement: the WRITE gate (cc-task-gate) and BOTH push gates
   (authorization-packet-validator, pr-release-gate) resolve through ``hapax_effective_role``
   and never infer role from the git branch — so push and write can never disagree on who
   a session is.
3. The SessionStart emitter (``session-context.sh``) — the original cns-vs-alpha root
   cause — proclaims ``roleless`` (never ``alpha``) for a roleless cwd.
4. A roleless session (``ROLE=''``) does not share role-keyed state — the
   ``cc-active-task-`` empty-suffix collision class.

Self-contained per project convention — no shared conftest fixtures.

def test_claim_plane_scripts_never_bind_role_through_the_bare_identity_resolver() -> None:
    """Invariant 5, derived rather than enumerated: no shell script that touches a
    ``cc-active-task-`` claim file binds role through the bare ``hapax_agent_identity``,
    unless it is on ``_BARE_IDENTITY_ALLOWED`` with a recorded reason.

    The name states the NEGATIVE deliberately. An earlier name promised that every such
    script "resolves role through the shared resolver", which is a stronger claim than
    the scan makes — see the MATCHING and ROOT limits below. A test whose name overstates
    its assertion is the same defect this file exists to catch, one level up: a rule
    represented but not enforced.

    The claim plane has three participants and one fact — which role holds this claim.
    The WRITER (cc-claim) and the READER (cc-task-gate) always agreed; the RELEASER
    (cc-close) bound through ``hapax_agent_identity``, which returns EMPTY exactly where
    the shared resolver returns "roleless". cc-close guards its release block with
    ``[[ -n "$role" ]]``, so the lease survived the close and the gate — reading through
    the other resolver — blocked every later mutation with "claimed task not found in
    vault". A session that finished its work correctly was left worse off than one that
    abandoned it (measured twice, 2026-08-21, both recoveries operator-driven).

    This is written as a scan with an allowlist rather than a list of known consumers on
    purpose. The cross-consumer test above enumerates three gates, and cc-close was a
    fourth consumer of the same fact that the enumeration simply did not mention — so the
    defect was invisible to the test whose stated job was cross-consumer agreement. A new
    claim-plane script now fails this by default and has to justify itself into the
    allowlist.

    RECORDED LIMIT — this scan asserts only the NEGATIVE (no bare-identity binding). A
    review seat correctly observed that rejecting the wrong resolver is not the same as
    requiring the right one: a new script with a hand-rolled env cascade and no resolver
    call would pass. The positive was attempted and is NOT assertable by text scan, and
    the failed attempt is worth recording so it is not retried blindly:

    * "touches ``cc-active-task-``" over-selects — lane reapers, health checks and claim
      audits sweep OTHER sessions' leases and correctly never resolve a self-role.
    * narrowing to "also resolves a self-role" still over-selects — the spawners
      (``hapax-claude``, ``hapax-vibe``, ``hapax-codex-headless``, ...) SET the env
      cascade that everything else reads, and setting is textually indistinguishable
      from reading.

    Measured 2026-08-21 on the narrowed population: 7 scripts resolve through the shared
    resolver, 7 do not, and all 7 of the latter are spawners or audits rather than
    defects. A third discriminator would be the third guard on one hazard — the point at
    which the shape, not the boundary, is wrong.

    The positive closes one level down, where it is mechanically decidable: a script
    either calls the shared claim-key builder (``hapax_agent_claim_key``) or it does
    not. That is deferred work, described here by what it is rather than by a task id —
    an id cited in a comment is unverifiable from inside the test and rots silently,
    while the named function is checkable by grep and fails loudly if it disappears.

    MATCHING LIMIT — comment stripping is line-prefix only, so a bare-resolver mention in
    a TRAILING comment on a code line would still be flagged. Accepted rather than
    patched: stripping mid-line ``#`` cannot distinguish a comment from a ``#`` inside a
    string or a parameter expansion, and would trade a loud false positive for a silent
    false negative.

    ROOT LIMIT — this scan covers SHELL participants under ``scripts/`` and
    ``hooks/scripts/`` only. It does not reach Python consumers (which do not source
    ``agent-role.sh`` and resolve role by other means) or any claim-plane script living
    outside those two roots. Widening it belongs with giving ``hapax_agent_claim_key`` a
    return shape its callers can use and routing every consumer through it, in both
    languages — the level where this closes properly, as one builder rather than one
    scan per convention. Described by the function rather than by a task id, for the
    reason given just above: an id in a comment cannot be checked from here.
