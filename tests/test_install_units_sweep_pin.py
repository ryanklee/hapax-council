"""install-units.sh regression pins.

Delta 2026-04-14-systemd-timer-enablement-gap.md identified that 14
of 51 council timers were in linked-but-not-enabled state because the
install script only enabled *newly* linked timers, not existing linked
ones. This test pins:

1. The script has a sweep that finds linked-but-not-enabled timers
   and runs ``systemctl --user enable`` on them.
2. The script aborts when run from any worktree other than primary
   alpha (to prevent the runtime bug where running from a temporary
   worktree re-links every systemd symlink to the worktree path).
3. The script uses idempotent ``enable`` in the sweep (not
   ``enable --now``) so dormant timers come up on their natural
   schedule rather than firing synchronously during install.
4. The override env var ``ALLOW_NONSTANDARD_REPO`` is present for
   intentional testing.
