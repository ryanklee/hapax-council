"""Tests for hooks/scripts/pii-guard.sh.

PreToolUse blocker for Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit that scans
the new content for high-confidence PII patterns:

- Operator full name (case-insensitive)
- Location data (city pattern)
- Home-directory absolute paths outside infrastructure-file exceptions
- Browsing/audio data path references

Skips: gitignored files, binary files, non-edit tool calls. Hook was
untested.

All PII strings used as test inputs are constructed at runtime via
concatenation so they don't appear as literals in this source — that
way the live pii-guard doesn't block the writing of this file.

# guard exists to prevent — and it does so under a heading that explains what they are. Caught in
# review; the correction is the same convention this file already applies to names, which its own
# docstring states: nothing that would be a disclosure appears as a literal here.
#
# So the in-range cases are the ENDS of the guard's 1..19 window plus its midpoint. That carries
# no household information and is strictly better coverage than two interior points: an off-by-one
# at either boundary now fails, and an interior pair would not have caught it.
