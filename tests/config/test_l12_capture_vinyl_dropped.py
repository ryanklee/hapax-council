"""Regression test: L-12 broadcast capture must drop vinyl + PC + MASTER channels.

Pins the post-2026-04-21 architecture where the only non-microphone source
reaching broadcast is the Evil Pet hardware return (AUX5). Direct vinyl
capture (AUX8/9), direct PC capture (AUX10/11), and MASTER capture (AUX12/13)
are all unbound from the capture node.

Trigger: 2026-04-23 ContentID warning during vinyl-through-Evil-Pet wet
processing motivated the broader content-source registry epic. This test
prevents accidental reintroduction of direct vinyl capture in any future PR.

Post-2026-04-25 (PR #1471): the capture node was further narrowed from
``audio.channels = 14`` (with null entries for unused AUX positions) to
``audio.channels = 4`` (only the AUX positions actually wired into the
filter graph: AUX1 contact / AUX3 sampler / AUX4 rode / AUX5 evilpet).
The forbidden AUX positions (8-13) now don't exist in the binding at
all — a stronger invariant than "bound but null". This test reflects
that structural shape.

Related: ``docs/governance/evil-pet-broadcast-source-policy.md``,
``config/pipewire/hapax-l12-evilpet-capture.conf``.
