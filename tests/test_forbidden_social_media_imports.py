"""Forbidden-import CI guard for multi-user-platform client libraries.

The "social_media" in the filename is shorthand: this guard covers
all multi-user platform clients where engagement expectations
collide with the single-operator axiom or the full-automation
envelope.

Per cc-tasks:
  - ``leverage-REFUSED-twitter-linkedin-substack-accounts``: Twitter/X,
    LinkedIn, Substack are operator-mediated relationship-management
    surfaces, not daemon-tractable.
  - ``leverage-REFUSED-discord-community``: Discord is multi-user;
    single-operator axiom precludes community moderation. Per
    ``awareness-refused-slack-discord-dm-bots`` precedent, slack and
    discord webhook clients are also refused.
  - ``leverage-REFUSED-wikipedia-auto-edit``: Wikipedia is multi-user;
    ToS forbids unflagged bot editing; flagged-bot path requires
    operator-mediated edit-approval workflow.
  - ``leverage-REFUSED-bot-driven-sc-inflation``: SoundCloud ToS forbids
    bot-driven plays / follows / reposts. Enforced as a path-based
    guard (``FORBIDDEN_PACKAGE_PATHS``) rather than a library-import
    guard because the legitimate ``agents/soundcloud_adapter/`` reads
    SC for bed-music routing (per
    ``project_soundcloud_bed_music_routing``).

All refusals trace to ``feedback_full_automation_or_no_engagement``
(operator constitutional directive 2026-04-25). The guard is a
grep-based test (no AST parsing required) that walks the agents/,
shared/, scripts/, and logos/ trees.

Bridgy POSSE fan-out from omg.lol weblog reaches Mastodon + Bluesky;
that is the only authorized social fan-out path. Wikipedia citations
to Hapax can arrive organically via third-party editors who notice
arXiv preprint / Zenodo DOI — daemon participation is unnecessary.

Editing the forbidden list directly is governance-protected — these
strings come out of the operator's constitutional posture and
removing them without an axiom-precedent change is a non-starter.
