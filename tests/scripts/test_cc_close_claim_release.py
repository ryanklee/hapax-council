"""cc-close must release the claim of the session that is actually claiming it.

The claim plane has three participants and one fact — *which role holds this
claim*:

* the WRITER, ``cc-claim``, which binds role via ``hapax_effective_role``
* the READER, ``cc-task-gate.impl.sh``, which binds role via ``hapax_effective_role``
* the RELEASER, ``cc-close``, which bound role via ``hapax_agent_identity``

Those two resolvers agree for every session that carries an explicit role, and
disagree for exactly one case: a session with a session id but no role signal.
``hapax_agent_identity`` returns EMPTY there; ``hapax_effective_role`` returns
the literal ``roleless``. ``cc-close`` guards its whole claim-release block with
``[[ -n "$role" ]]``, so with the divergent resolver the block was skipped, the
lease survived the close, and the gate — resolving through the other function —
found a lease naming a task that had just moved to ``closed/`` and blocked every
subsequent mutation with ``claimed task not found in vault``.

Measured twice on 2026-08-21, both times immediately after a *clean* close: a
session that finished its work correctly ended up worse off than one that
abandoned it, and both recoveries needed the operator.

``tests/scripts/test_cc_close_session_lease.py`` already pins the release LOOP
(reform finding #12/#13) but sets ``HAPAX_AGENT_ROLE=eta`` in every case, so
``$role`` is never empty and the guard above the loop is never exercised. The
repair was applied at the loop; the failure moved one level up to the binding.
These tests drive the roleless case end to end instead: real ``cc-close``, real
gate, real vault layout.
