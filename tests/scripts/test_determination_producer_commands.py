"""A producer the spine cannot launch is a property the estate cannot determine.

Measured 2026-08-19: `scripts/hapax-claude-account-live-observe` merged in #4582 committed as
mode 100644 while its sibling `scripts/hapax-agy-quota-admission` was 100755. Nothing caught
it — the PR was fully green — because no test asserts that a registered producer's command is
actually runnable. It happened to work at runtime only because the source-activation copy lands
755 on disk incidentally; a deploy that reproduced the tree faithfully (`git archive`, a clean
checkout, a container COPY) would produce 644, and every run would raise PermissionError. The
spine reports that as `unlaunchable` — which at a glance is indistinguishable from the honest
"this capability is not available on this host".

The registry is a promise that these commands can be run. This pins the promise.

    That was fair — both substitutes were one step away from the thing being claimed.

    This uses the command the activator actually runs. ``scripts/hapax-source-activate:421``:

        git -C "$CANONICAL_REPO" worktree add --detach "$candidate_worktree" "$sha" --quiet

    and that script contains no ``chmod`` at any point, so a release tree materialises every file
    at exactly the mode HEAD records. That is why the mode bit is the whole defect: with 100644 in
    HEAD the tree is born non-executable, something downstream chmods it to run, and the tree is
    permanently dirty thereafter.

    Asserts the predicate's own three clauses on a tree built that way: git reports it clean, the
    adjudicator measures ``dirty=False``, and ``record_identifies_its_checkout()`` returns True.
    Raised by codex-1 — an earlier version checked ``status`` and ``os.access`` but never
    evaluated the identity, which is the clause the predicate actually names, so it asserted
    everything around the claim and not the claim.

    Materialised at ``<trusted releases root>/<sha>/`` so it is classified ``release_tree``
    exactly as a deployed one is, rather than as an incidental checkout.
