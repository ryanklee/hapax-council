"""Canary: every raw high-priority system alert must route through governed P0 intake.

Class-closure regression guard for the PR #4109 finding ("raw high-priority
alert sources bypass P0 intake"). Standalone watchdog / health scripts used to
call ``notify-send -u critical`` or POST ntfy ``Priority: high`` directly, so
their alerts never created a governed incident record AND stacked un-coalesced
in the desktop queue.

PER-EMIT, not per-file. An earlier version of this canary only checked that a
governed-routing substring appeared *somewhere* in a file — so a file that
routed one branch passed even while another branch emitted raw (the exact gap
the #4109 review caught at lane-idle-watchdog:639 and lane-supervisor:571). This
version enumerates EVERY raw emit and asserts governed routing for each:

  * Desktop: a raw ``notify-send`` at critical/urgent urgency is ALWAYS a
    violation — high/urgent desktop alerts must go through hapax-alert so intake
    emits ONE replace_id-coalesced pointer instead of an accumulating mako queue.
  * ntfy: each ``Priority: high|urgent|max`` header must have a governed call
    (hapax-alert / hapax-p0-incident-intake) within +/- WINDOW lines (same block).
