"""Gain-discipline regression pins — evilpet-s4-routing Phase 3.

Spec §9 invariant: software gain stages stay at unity unless the
existing documented exceptions (currently the L6 main-mix +12 dB
makeup) are explicitly justified in the conf header. Any new
filter-chain gain stage must update this test to keep the invariant
enforceable.

Also pins the R1 routing spec invariants so a future spec edit
can't silently delete the TTS → Evil Pet → livestream documentation
that downstream wiring depends on.
