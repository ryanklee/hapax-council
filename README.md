**Operationalizing Clark & Brennan's (1991) conversational grounding theory in a production voice AI** — the first system to implement collaborative grounding mechanics rather than profile-gated retrieval.

## Statement of Need

Every frontier voice AI treats memory as profile retrieval — storing facts about the user and injecting them into context. None implement Clark & Brennan's contribution-acceptance cycle, repair sequences, or effort calibration. Shaikh et al. (ACL 2025) showed all frontier LLMs score 23.23% on grounding tasks — worse than random. RLHF actively suppresses grounding acts (Shaikh, NAACL 2024). OpenAI's model spec instructs models *not* to ask clarifying questions. The 35-year gap between Clark's theory and any implementation is not accidental — it reflects structural obstacles in how conversational AI is built.

This project implements the grounding theory mechanically: a discourse unit state machine (Traum 1994), concern-aware repair thresholds, acceptance classification, Grounding Quality Index (GQI), and 2D effort calibration — all external to the LLM, injected as directives. The system is evaluated via Single Case Experimental Design (SCED) with Bayesian analysis (BEST).

## Research Design

**Methodology:** ABA reversal SCED (Single Case Experimental Design) with Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t-Test (BEST). Sequential stopping rules. HDI+ROPE decision criteria.

**Independent variable:** Grounding system (3 treatment components + 1 diagnostic sentinel):
1. Conversation thread with conceptual pact preservation (Brennan & Clark 1996)
2. Grounding ledger with DU state machine and strategy directives
3. Memory integration with cross-session DU persistence
4. Sentinel fact (diagnostic only — tests retrieval, not grounding)

**Dependent variables:** Turn-pair coherence (embedding-based), GQI, acceptance rate, monologic score (RLHF anti-pattern detector), directive compliance.

**Current status:**
- Cycle 1 (pilot): Complete. 37 sessions, BF=3.66 inconclusive, word overlap metric inadequate.
- Cycle 2: Implementation complete (Batches 1-4, 76 tests passing). Pre-registration and OSF registration pending.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ryanklee/hapax-council.git && cd hapax-council
uv sync
uv run pytest tests/ -q          # 470+ test files
uv run ruff check .               # lint
uv run pyright                    # type check
```

For production use (agents, cockpit API, voice daemon), see [Architecture](#architecture).

## Architecture

Three independent loops communicate through the filesystem and /dev/shm:

```
Loop 1: Perception (voice daemon, 2.5s tick)
  Sensors → Bayesian presence → Governor → Consent → perception-state.json

Loop 2: Visual Aggregator (3s tick, adaptive 0.5-5s)
  Perception → Stimmung → Temporal Bands → Apperception → /dev/shm

Loop 3: Reactive Engine (inotify, event-driven)
  profiles/ + axioms/ → Rule evaluation → Phased execution (deterministic → GPU → cloud)
```

### Grounding system (research core)

```
Operator utterance
  → Acceptance classifier (ACCEPT/CLARIFY/IGNORE/REJECT)
  → Grounding ledger (DU state: PENDING → GROUNDED/REPAIR/ABANDONED/CONTESTED)
  → Concern-aware repair threshold ("sufficient for current purposes")
  → GQI computation (50% EWMA acceptance + 25% trend + 15% neg penalty + 10% engagement)
  → 2D effort calibration (activation × GQI discount → EFFICIENT/BASELINE/ELABORATIVE)
  → Strategy directive (advance/rephrase/elaborate/present_reasoning/move_on)
  → Injected into VOLATILE band of system prompt
```

### Voice daemon

Wake word → VAD → STT (faster-whisper, GPU) → Salience routing → LLM (via LiteLLM) → Streaming TTS (Kokoro) → Audio output. Phenomenal context renderer injects temporal bands and stimmung, scaled per tier.

### Constitutional governance

Five axioms produce 90 implications via four interpretive canons. Enforced at four tiers (T0 blocked → T3 lint). Novel cases produce precedents with authority hierarchy.

### Consent framework

ConsentLabel (DLM join-semilattice), Labeled[T] (LIO functor), Says monad (Abadi DCC), PosBool(X) provenance semirings, GateToken (linear discipline). Properties verified via Hypothesis.

### Phenomenological perception

Husserlian temporal bands (retention/impression/protention/surprise), Bayesian presence engine (8-signal fusion), apperception cascade (7-step, 6 safeguards), SystemStimmung (6 dimensions).

## Computational Requirements

- **OS:** Linux (tested on CachyOS/Arch)
- **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) for local inference + GPU effects
- **RAM:** 32GB recommended
