# Grafana dashboards

Authoritative copies of Grafana dashboard JSON live in this directory. Grafana reads dashboards from `~/llm-stack/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/json/` (bind-mounted into the container at `/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/json`); deployment is a symlink or copy from here to there.

## Dashboards

| File | UID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `studio-cameras.json` | (per-file) | Phase 4 of the camera 24/7 resilience epic. Source: `agents/studio_compositor/metrics.py` on `127.0.0.1:9482`. |
| `lrr-per-condition.json` | `lrr-per-condition` | LRR Phase 10 §3.1 per-condition LLM call slicing. Every LLM call site publishes `hapax_llm_calls_total` / `hapax_llm_call_latency_seconds` / `hapax_llm_call_outcomes_total` tagged with the active research condition_id. |
| `lrr-stimmung.json` | `lrr-stimmung` | LRR Phase 10 affect + system-state dashboard. 11 stimmung dimensions + overall stance + freshness. Source: `/api/predictions/metrics` (logos, scraped at 30s). |
| `finding-x-grounding.json` | `finding-x-grounding` | FINDING-X grounding-provenance constitutional-invariant observability. Surfaces `hapax_director_ungrounded_total` (raw LLM empty rate, pre-synthesis) + `hapax_director_ungrounded_synth_total{intent_family}` (synth-fallback rate). Rising synth rate = LLM-compliance drift. Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-finding-x-grounding-synth-design.md` §5. |

## Install

One-time symlink (recommended — updates to the council repo propagate automatically):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/llm-stack/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/json
for f in ~/projects/hapax-council/grafana/dashboards/*.json; do
    ln -sf "$f" ~/llm-stack/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/json/$(basename "$f")
done
```

Then reload provisioning:

```bash
docker restart grafana
# or via the Grafana UI: Dashboards → Browse → Provisioning → Reload
```

## Dashboard-under-repo invariant

Dashboards committed to this directory are the authoritative copy. Never hand-edit the JSON under `~/llm-stack/` directly — that's the live bind-mount target. Edits should go through a council-repo PR so they survive rebuilds, migrations, and diff reviews.
